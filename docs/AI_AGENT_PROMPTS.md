## üë®‚Äçüíª AGENT A: Backend & Calculation Engine

### **Your Mission**
Build the core calculation engine and database foundation that powers both the admin calculator and client proposals.

### **Specific Prompt**
```
You are a senior backend developer building the calculation engine for Louis Amy AE Studio's proposal platform. 

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement exact formulas from Excel model (see docs/APP_LOGIC.md)
2. Use Supabase PostgreSQL for data storage
3. Create TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
4. Build API endpoints for calculator and proposal generation
5. Ensure sub-100ms calculation response times

FIRST TASKS:
1. Setup Supabase database with building cost tables
2. Implement core budget calculation function
3. Add engineering discipline allocation logic
4. Create three-option proposal generation
5. Build API routes for admin calculator

FORMULA PRIORITIES (implement in order):
- Budget calculations (area √ó cost/sf)
- Category multipliers (1-5 ‚Üí 0.9-1.3)  
- Engineering discipline shares
- Hours calculation (non-linear: 0.21767 + 11.21274 √ó area^-0.53816)
- Fee structures (market vs Louis Amy pricing)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- /lib/calculations.ts with exact Excel formulas
- /lib/database.ts with Supabase queries
- /api/calculate/* endpoints
- TypeScript interfaces in /lib/types.ts

VALIDATION TESTS:
Dr. De Jes√∫s project (4407 ft¬≤ existing, Category 5):
- All validations read from CONSTANTS[MODE].VALIDATION in lib/constants.ts
- Default MODE: 'EXCEL' (Hours=1184, Contract=$137,743.50)  
- Alternative MODE: 'SSOT' (Hours=1148.27, Contract=$187,925.55)

CRITICAL: Use calibrated expectations, not hardcoded numbers:
```typescript
import { CONFIG } from '@/lib/constants'
expect(result.totalHours).toBeCloseTo(CONFIG.VALIDATION.totalHours, 2)
expect(result.contractPrice).toBeCloseTo(CONFIG.VALIDATION.contractPrice, 2)
```

NOTE: Client-facing options (A=$187,099, B=$126,636, C=$87,898) are strategic 
pricing from CLIENT_OPTIONS constant and never calculated from contract price.

## üîÑ Cross-Agent Communication Protocol

### **Daily Standups (Every 4 Hours)**
Each agent reports:
1. **Completed:** What functionality is working
2. **In Progress:** Current task and estimated completion
3. **Blockers:** Dependencies on other agents
4. **Next:** Planned tasks for next 4-hour sprint

### **Shared Resources**
- **Types:** `/lib/types.ts` - Single source of truth for interfaces
- **Constants:** `/lib/constants.ts` - Shared values and configurations
- **Utils:** `/lib/utils.ts` - Common helper functions
- **Styles:** Global Tailwind classes and component variants

### **Conflict Resolution**
1. **Data conflicts:** Backend agent has authority
2. **UI conflicts:** Follow shadcn/ui patterns
3. **Business logic:** Reference Chris Do documentation
4. **Performance conflicts:** Mobile experience takes priority

### **Integration Points**
```typescript
// Shared interface for calculation results
interface CalculationResults {
  budgets: ProjectBudgets
  disciplines: DisciplineBudgets
  hours: ProjectHours
  fees: FeeStructure
  options: ThreeOptions
}

// Shared event system
type ProposalEvent = 
  | 'calculation_updated'
  | 'option_selected'
  | 'proposal_generated'
  | 'client_conversion'
```

## üö® Emergency Escalation

### **When to Flag for Human Review**
- Calculation results don't match Excel model
- Chris Do principles conflict with technical constraints
- Major architectural decisions needed
- Client requirements change mid-development
- Performance targets cannot be met

### **Emergency Contact Protocol**
1. **Document the issue** in GitHub issue
2. **Tag all relevant agents** for awareness  
3. **Reference specific documentation** that conflicts
4. **Propose 2-3 potential solutions** with trade-offs
5. **Continue with best judgment** while awaiting input
