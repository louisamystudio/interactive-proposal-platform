UI Design Guidelines for the New Engineering Cost Calculator

These guidelines provide a blueprint for building a modern, interactive dashboard that follows the spirit of Uber’s Base design system. Base emphasises a unified look and feel across products through design tokens, a pared‑back typographic palette, and clear semantic roles for text. At the heart of these guidelines is transparency: every number or visual element should be traceable back to user inputs, default data or formulas. When in doubt, prefer clarity over decoration and use the Base system’s foundations as your north star.

1. Overall Structure

Break the dashboard into logical sections that mirror the calculation flow:

Project Inputs & Cost Ranges – Collect all configuration inputs (building type/tier, design level, category, areas, historic/remodel multipliers). Display min/target/max cost per ft² as interactive sliders. Show the underlying ranges from the cost‑ranges table and allow users to drag the target marker.

Budget Distribution – Present the total new and remodel budgets and split them into shell, interior and landscape budgets. Provide number inputs (or sliders) for overriding the default shares. Validate that the three shares sum to 100 %; if a user edits one or two values, either automatically adjust the remaining share or block saving until the sum is correct.

Discipline Budgets – Show a card for each discipline (Architecture, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Telecommunication) with the calculated budget split into new and remodel portions. Include editable percentage inputs so users can override the engineering shares. Offer a toggle on each card to mark the discipline as in‑house or outsourced.

Top‑Down Fee Analysis – Display a table with columns for scope, percent of project cost, rate per ft², market fee, Louis Amy fee, consultant fee and coordination fee. Show the discipline budgets used to compute the fees. Include the Scan‑to‑BIM fees as their own rows when enabled.

Bottom‑Up Fee Analysis – Provide inputs for labour rate, overhead rate, markup factor and discount. Show the resulting labour cost, overhead cost, with markup and final bottom‑up fee. Display the hours by role and phase from the hours distribution. Include a comparison to the top‑down market fee and highlight any large variances.

Sanity Check & Contract Price – Summarise the top‑down and bottom‑up fees as a percentage of construction cost and as a rate per ft². Compute the difference between the two methods and offer an input for manual discount override. Display the maximum discount allowed and the resulting contract price after discount.

Export & Save – Provide buttons to save the current project, export the configuration and methodology, and import a saved configuration. Indicate the time of last update.

2. Interactive Controls

Sliders – Use multi‑thumb sliders for cost ranges with clearly labelled min, target and max points. Dragging the target thumb should immediately recalculate budgets and downstream values. Sliders for areas and multipliers should have sensible increments (e.g. 100 ft² for areas, 1 % for share overrides).

Numeric Inputs – For shares and percentages, use number inputs with spin controls. Attach onChange handlers that update state and trigger recalculation. Prevent invalid values (e.g. negative numbers or sums that exceed 100 %).

Toggles – Provide on/off switches for historic property status, scan‑to‑BIM inclusion, non‑linear hours, and in‑house vs outsourced for each discipline. When toggled, trigger recalculation and update the fee distribution (Louis Amy vs consultant vs coordination).

Debouncing & Auto‑recalc – Debounce updates (200–300 ms) to avoid multiple rapid recalculations. Show a spinner or subtle animation while recalculation is in progress.

3. Data Visualisation

Donut or Pie Chart – Represent the proportion of new vs remodel area or budget as a donut chart. Label each segment with its percentage and value.

Stacked Bar Charts – For each discipline, display new and remodel budgets side by side or stacked. This helps users visualise the impact of the remodel multiplier on structural budgets.

Range Bars – Use horizontal bars to depict cost ranges (min–max) with the current target indicated as a dot. Consider colour‑coding (e.g. green for new, blue for remodel).

Tooltip & Details – Provide hover tooltips or expandable panels that explain how each number is computed, which formulas were used and what data source was referenced. This reinforces transparency and trust.

4. Validation & Error Handling

Validate that share overrides (shell, interior, landscape and discipline percentages) are within 0–100 % and that the totals sum correctly. Highlight invalid inputs in red and disable recalculation until corrected.

Ensure cost targets remain within their min–max ranges. Clamp or snap values to the nearest bound if necessary.

Provide informative error messages when inputs are out of range or missing. Errors should suggest the corrective action.

Warn users if the difference between top‑down and bottom‑up fees exceeds ±15 % or if the hours per ft² fall outside the typical range (0.3–1.5 hr/ft²).

5. Base Design System Principles and Aesthetics

The Base design system emphasises clarity, restraint and semantic structure. Integrate these principles into every element of the calculator:

Design tokens – Use tokens (named values that represent colours, typography, spacing, etc.) for every visual decision. Tokens promote consistency across the application and align with the Base system’s goal of unifying the experience across products. Whenever you specify a colour, font size or spacing value, reference a token rather than a literal number. If you need a new token, define it centrally and derive its values from the existing Base palette and scale.

Typography – Adopt Base’s modular typographic system. It uses a modular scale with a ratio of 8:9 and starts from a 14 pt base size. Multiply by 1.125 to step up the hierarchy. Four semantic roles keep the palette simple:

Display – the largest text, used sparingly for page titles or hero numbers. It embodies the “go big” principle: larger type is easier to read and adds dramatic impact.

Heading – for section titles and to break up content; should be bold and clearly distinct from body text.

Label – short phrases providing context, such as field labels or card titles. Use a mid‑weight style that stands apart from paragraphs.

Paragraph – for longer explanatory text. Keep paragraph styles simple, with consistent line height.
Base encourages less is more: limit the number of sizes per role to avoid decision fatigue and maintain rhythm. Use the 1.45× line‑height rule and snap values to the nearest 4 pt to align with a 4 pt baseline grid

. Use spacing below a text block equal to line height minus font size, rounded to the nearest 4 pt, to maintain vertical rhythm

.

Semantic simplicity – Group text styles semantically rather than by arbitrary size. The Display, Heading, Label and Paragraph categories provide enough guidance without being prescriptive. Use them consistently across the interface.

Go big and bold for key numbers – Large financial figures (budgets, fees, hours) are central to the calculator. Use the Display role or a large Heading style to make them immediately visible. Avoid mixing too many sizes in one card; emphasise the primary value and support it with smaller labels and explanatory text

Colour and contrast – The official Base color guidelines are behind a login, but the general principle is to use high contrast for readability and rely on a limited palette. Select one primary accent colour (e.g. Uber’s brand teal) for interactive elements (sliders, toggles, buttons) and use neutral greys and off‑whites for backgrounds. Reserve red or orange for warnings and validation messages. Ensure sufficient contrast ratios to support accessibility.

Spacing and grids – Adhere to a 4 pt spacing system. Margins, paddings and gaps between components should be multiples of 4. Use Base’s layout grids and breakpoints to structure cards and tables. Introduce white space generously between sections to avoid visual clutter.

Minimalism in components – Reflect Base’s “less is more” principle by avoiding over‑decoration. Buttons, sliders and inputs should be simple in appearance, with clear affordances and high contrast. Use icons sparingly and only when they aid comprehension; never rely on icons alone for important actions.

Responsiveness – Maintain responsiveness across devices. On smaller screens, stack elements vertically; on larger screens, place budget cards and discipline cards in multiple columns. Ensure that type scales gracefully with screen size by using responsive units derived from the modular scale.

6. Recommended Libraries and Tools

Continue to leverage Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for their accessibility and utility‑first approaches. To align with Base, encapsulate Tailwind classes into components that map directly to design tokens (e.g. classes for tokenised spacing or typography). For data visualisation, consider Recharts or VisX, which integrate with React and support custom styling to match your chosen palette. Use Zod or a similar schema validation library to enforce input constraints, and TanStack Query to handle asynchronous calls to the calculation service.

7. Accessibility and Semantics

Base’s emphasis on clarity extends naturally to accessibility:

All interactive elements must be keyboard operable. Provide clear focus states and ARIA labels that describe each slider, number input or toggle.

Provide text equivalents for charts, such as tables or captions, so that screen readers can convey the same information.

Use proper semantic HTML elements and roles. Headings (<h1>…<h4>) should reflect the information hierarchy; lists (<ul>, <ol>) for grouped items; buttons for actions; and labels associated with inputs.

Ensure that validation messages and warnings are announced to screen readers using ARIA live regions or polite announcements.

By following these Base‑aligned design principles—using a modular typographic scale, clearly defined semantic roles, consistent tokens and restrained colour usage—you will build an interface that feels cohesive, modern and easy to navigate. Combined with the interactive controls and data visualisation guidelines above, this approach will eliminate the confusion and inconsistencies of previous iterations and provide a foundation that scales with future features.
