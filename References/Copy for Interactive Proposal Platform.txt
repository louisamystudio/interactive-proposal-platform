Interactive Options Comparison

We offer three proposal options so you can choose the level of service that fits you best. Each option is presented as a fixed-price investment – no hourly billing, no surprises – and each delivers a different scope of outcome and value. All three paths will achieve your core project goals; the difference is how fully integrated our services are. Compare your options:

Option A – Fully Integrated Vision: The ultimate, all-inclusive design package covering every detail of your project (architecture, interiors, landscape). This option provides maximum cohesion, streamlined decision-making, and a single point of accountability from start to finish, ensuring a completely turnkey experience. If you want total peace of mind and a truly bespoke transformation, Option A delivers it. Fixed Investment: $187,099.

Option B – Collaborative Partnership: A balanced co-creative approach. We lead the architectural, structural, and landscape design while collaborating with your chosen interior designer. You get expert guidance on the big architectural moves and site design, preserving your personal interior style through your own designer. The result is a professionally coordinated, cohesive home design with more flexibility in finishes. Fixed Investment: $126,636.

Option C – Architectural Foundation: An essential architecture-only package focusing on the core shell and outdoor layout. We deliver the fundamental design framework – a transformed exterior, reconfigured layouts, and structural plans – ready for you to build on with interior design and decor of your choice. This option covers the crucial basics at the most accessible investment level, giving you a solid base and the freedom to manage the remaining details. Fixed Investment: $87,898.

(All options above are presented as flat-fee investments in your project’s success – no hourly rates or hidden add-ons.) Choose the path that aligns with your needs, and dive into the details below to see exactly what each includes and how it delivers value.

Details for Each Option
Option A: Fully Integrated Vision

Outcome: Option A delivers a truly end-to-end transformation of your home. The outcome is a fully unified design where architecture, interior decor, and landscape blend seamlessly into your ideal living environment. Every aspect – from the new façade lines to the furniture layouts – is meticulously planned and tailored to you. This is the fastest, most cohesive path to your dream home; you’ll receive a complete vision of luxury realized with no compromises. In the end, you’ll step into a residence that feels custom-built for your life, with a wow-factor outcome that elevates your lifestyle and property to a legacy-worthy level.

Scope: What’s included in Option A:

All-In-One Design Team: A single, integrated team handles everything – Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape Design, plus full engineering coordination (structural, civil, plumbing, electrical). With one unified studio accountable for every detail, nothing falls through the cracks. We ensure every element of your home is designed in harmony, providing absolute consistency and quality control.

Reality Capture & BIM Precision: We begin by laser-scanning your existing home and site (Scan-to-BIM) to create an ultra-precise 3D model. This digital foundation means our plans are rooted in reality from day one. The benefit to you? Fewer surprises, no guesswork – every design decision is informed by accurate data, vastly reducing construction risks.

Immersive Visualization: Experience your future home before it’s built. Option A includes extensive visualizations: photorealistic renderings and interactive virtual reality tours of both your redesigned interiors and exteriors. Walk through your new kitchen layout, explore the master suite, or stand in your reimagined backyard in VR. This immersion lets you feel the space, give feedback, and make confident choices early – resulting in fewer late changes and complete certainty about the design.

Custom Interiors & Lighting Design: Our team designs every interior detail to reflect your taste – from space planning and cabinetry to lighting schemes and luxury finishes. We believe lighting is the unsung hero of a great space, so we craft illumination that highlights architecture and sets the perfect mood. You’ll see bespoke elements (built-ins, material palettes, fixtures) come to life that are uniquely yours. The result is an interior that’s not only beautiful and cohesive, but also deeply personal and highly functional.

Permitting & Construction Support: We prepare a full set of permit-ready plans for architecture and all integrated engineering. Our expertise in local codes means the design will sail through approvals. Once design is complete, we don’t disappear – we remain by your side during construction. Option A includes our guidance and periodic site visits during the build, acting as your advocate to ensure the project is executed according to plan. This oversight protects your investment and gives you peace of mind all the way to move-in day.

Value: Option A offers an unparalleled level of service and assurance. It’s the ultimate peace-of-mind package – you hand us your aspirations, and we handle every detail of making it real. This means you avoid the stress of coordinating multiple consultants or making tough decisions alone. The design process is highly efficient (one team means fast decisions and a unified vision) which can shorten timelines and reduce costly back-and-forth. Most importantly, the outcome is transformative: a home that is completely custom, cohesive, and ready to enjoy. By investing in this top-tier option, you’re investing in zero regrets – the highest long-term value, a timeless dream home, and a smooth journey to get there. It’s a true turnkey solution that results in a residence of enduring quality and beauty – a personal sanctuary and an heirloom for your family.

Option B: Collaborative Partnership

Outcome: Option B produces a home design that marries professional architectural excellence with your personal interior style. The outcome is a thoroughly planned architectural and landscape transformation, coordinated to work hand-in-hand with the interior décor choices you make with your own designer. You will end up with a home that showcases our firm’s technical precision and cohesive vision in its bones (the layout, structure, exterior look, and outdoor living spaces), while reflecting the unique touches of your trusted interior designer. In other words, your home’s core will be architecturally sound and beautiful, and its interiors will carry the personalized aesthetic you desire. This collaborative result is a harmonious blend of our expertise and your style – delivering a final space that is cohesive, personalized, and undeniably “you.”

Scope: What’s included in Option B:

Architectural & Structural Design: We completely redesign the architecture of your home – developing the new floor plans, façade, and roof profile, and engineering all structural changes. From the layout of rooms to the modernized exterior style, we ensure the core of your remodel is expertly crafted. All plans and technical drawings for the architecture and structure are provided, permit-ready and builder-ready, covering the essential framework of your project. (This includes coordination with structural/civil engineers as needed so that the submitted plans meet all safety codes and regulations.)

Landscape & Outdoor Integration: Our scope extends to the outdoor living experience. We design key landscape and site elements – such as the terraces, pool area upgrades, and any outdoor kitchens or features on your wishlist – to create seamless indoor-outdoor connections. The exterior environment will be planned to complement the architecture, enhancing curb appeal and backyard enjoyment. You’ll have a coherent vision for your entire property’s layout and look, not just the house itself.

Integration with Your Interior Designer: We work hand-in-hand with your chosen interior designer to merge architecture with interior decor. Our team will provide your designer with all the needed architectural information and will coordinate on important decisions (for example, ensuring that built-in elements or lighting plans align with the structure). We remain available to review your interior designer’s proposals and advise on compatibility with the overall design. This means you retain the interior style and relationship you value, but without worrying about technical or aesthetic mismatches – we safeguard the cohesion of the project.

Precision Planning & Exterior Visualization: As with Option A, we utilize 3D laser scanning and BIM modeling for absolute accuracy in our plans. You’ll be able to visualize the transformed design of your home’s architecture with confidence. We provide high-quality visual previews focusing on the exterior and structural changes – for instance, an immersive virtual walkthrough of the new exterior. Stand in front of your revamped façade or “walk around” your redesigned patio in a virtual model. This way, you can clearly see how the architectural changes and landscape upgrades will look and feel, and you can approve the vision knowing it aligns with what you have in mind. (Detailed interior renderings would be handled by your interior designer, as interior design is outside our scope in this option.)

Documentation & Support: We deliver a comprehensive set of construction documents for everything we design. That includes stamped architectural plans and engineering drawings ready for permit submission for the architectural scope, as well as guidelines for integrating the interiors. We remain available to answer questions from you or your contractors about our design throughout the process. By covering the critical technical aspects and offering coordination, we take the heavy lifting off your shoulders in all areas where our expertise lies, while ensuring a smooth hand-off to your interior designer for furnishings and decor.

Value: Option B offers the best of both worlds for a client who wants professional design guidance but also values the involvement of a personal interior designer. You benefit from our firm handling all the complex, technical elements – structure, permits, exterior design, site planning – which reduces your risk significantly (no construction pitfalls from architectural mistakes, no delays from poor planning). At the same time, you maintain creative control over the interior atmosphere by working with your preferred interior specialist. This means you get a home that is architecturally sound and thoughtfully laid out by experts, without sacrificing your personal style in the decor. The investment level is lower than Option A, yet you still achieve a high-quality, coherent result. Many clients find this option gives them confidence that the “big things” are done right – foundation, flow, shell, systems – while enjoying flexibility in the “personal touches.” In short, Option B is about collaboration and balance: it provides a professionally orchestrated design framework for your project and lets you infuse your own taste where it matters most to you. The end result is a beautiful, well-built home that feels uniquely yours, delivered with less stress and a solid handle on costs.

Option C: Architectural Foundation

Outcome: Option C yields a solid architectural blueprint for your dream project. The outcome of this option is a fully developed plan for the essential structure and exterior of your home remodel – essentially, the transformed “shell” of your residence. You will have a complete set of architectural plans and an updated exterior design that modernizes your home’s look and improves its layout and structural flow. In other words, your home’s bones and appearance will be reimagined and ready for construction. What Option C does is set the stage: it delivers a beautiful, sound framework that you (and any other design professionals you engage for interiors or decor) can build upon. By the end of our work, you’ll have a dramatically improved exterior presence and core floor plan – a home that’s ready to enter construction with all major architectural decisions made. The interior finishes, decor, and other detailing can then be done at your pace, allowing you to complete the vision on your own terms. The key outcome is a transformed home from the outside in, with the final cosmetic and furnishing touches left flexible for you to control.

Scope: What’s included in Option C:

Core Architectural Design: We focus on the fundamental architectural elements of your project. This includes redesigning your floor plans for better spatial flow and functionality, reimagining the facades and rooflines for a fresh modern look, and engineering any structural modifications needed (for example, new openings, roof changes from sloped to flat, etc.). Our design addresses all your primary wishlist items at the architectural level – new kitchen layout, improved master suite configuration, facade modernization, and so on – ensuring the crucial improvements to your home’s form and function are achieved. Every plan is developed with precision and creativity, so even at this foundational level, your home will undergo a remarkable transformation in layout and curb appeal.

Exterior & Site Enhancements: In Option C, we also cover the exterior environment insofar as it connects to the architecture. We will plan upgrades to key outdoor areas directly tied to the building, such as entryway design, terraces, and the basic landscape layout, to ensure your indoor–outdoor flow is improved. For example, if a patio redesign or a new outdoor kitchen was on your wishlist, we’ll incorporate those elements conceptually into the architectural plans. The focus here is establishing the framework for outdoor living (layout, hardscape, how the pool and landscape integrate with the house) rather than detailed planting or lighting design. You’ll have a cohesive site plan that complements the new architecture, providing a guiding vision for later landscape or outdoor décor work by others.

Digital Accuracy & Exterior Visualization: Even with a streamlined scope, you benefit from our advanced process. We will perform a 3D laser scan of the existing structure and use BIM software to produce highly accurate plans. You’ll be able to review the exterior design through clear visual outputs – for instance, rendered images or a simple virtual model of the new facades – so you can see how the house will look after the changes. This visual reassurance helps you understand the transformation and approve the design with confidence. (Detailed interior renderings or virtual tours of the inside are not part of this foundational package, since interior design services are not included in Option C.) Our precise documentation means that when it’s time to build, the contractors have a reliable roadmap, and when it’s time for an interior designer to add finishes, they have an accurate canvas to work from.

Clear Handoffs for Interiors/Landscape: Because Option C leaves certain aspects (like interior design and detailed landscape design) to you or other professionals, we make sure to document the interfaces and assumptions clearly. We’ll delineate where our architectural scope ends and where your interior designer or other consultants will pick up. For example, we will mark provisions for things like kitchen cabinetry layouts or bathroom fixture locations and note coordination points (so whoever designs the cabinetry or selects the fixtures has the info they need to integrate with our plans). Essentially, we set up a smooth handoff by providing all the architectural background data your interior designer or decorator would require. This way, when you continue the project with additional services, there’s no guesswork – your team can build on a solid foundation that we’ve established.

Permit-Ready Documentation: We deliver a full package of architectural construction documents for the work we’ve designed. That includes plans, elevations, sections, and structural details covering the shell and core changes. These documents will be stamped by our licensed professionals and ready for submission to obtain building permits. In this option, systems like detailed electrical plans, interior cabinetry drawings, or specialty systems would be beyond our scope – but the drawings we provide will clearly show all needed architectural and structural information for approvals and construction. With these in hand, you can engage contractors to start building the core project, and bring in interior/landscape designers to complete the picture. We remain available to clarify our plans to your team as needed.

Value: Option C is designed for the client who wants to maximize impact on a smart budget and perhaps enjoys a more hands-on role in the project. The value it provides is delivering all the critical professional expertise where it counts – in the structural and architectural design – while keeping your upfront investment lower by leaving detail work to others or to a later phase. You still gain the benefits of working with a top-tier architectural team: a sound plan, avoidance of costly structural mistakes, compliance with codes, and an inspired exterior look, all of which protect and enhance the overall value of your property. At the same time, you maintain flexibility to finish out the interiors and finer details at your own pace, or as your budget allows, without being locked into a larger design fee. This option is ideal if you have a clear vision for your interior or have trusted people in mind for interior design – it empowers you to allocate resources where you most want them. In summary, Option C gives you professional guidance on the fundamentals (so you’re not going it alone on major architectural decisions) and a strong platform for future work. It’s a cost-conscious, phased approach: you invest in getting the “bones” of your dream home right, and you retain control to craft the finishing touches to your liking. The result will be a transformed home that has all the essential improvements in place, and you can take pride in having played a key role in bringing the full vision to life.

Step Inside Your Future Home

One of the most exciting parts of this proposal is that you don’t have to wait for construction to experience your new space. We’ve integrated interactive visualization to help you truly feel the design:

Imagine strapping on a VR headset or using your tablet to walk through your future living room and kitchen. With our Virtual Reality immersion, you can explore your renovated home in full scale. Every texture, every ray of light, every fixture and piece of millwork we’ve planned – all of it can be previewed in a realistic 3D environment. This isn’t just a slideshow of static renderings; it’s an interactive tour. Open doors, peek out from the new terrace to see the improved patio layout, or step into your master suite and see how the natural light falls across the room. By immersing yourself in the design, you can make informed choices and truly envision daily life in these new spaces. It’s a chance to confirm that the design feels right to you. We want you to love what you see, and this technology provides the ultimate test-drive for your dream home.

To explore, simply use the “Virtual Tour” link provided (or scan the QR code on your screen with your phone). You’ll be able to navigate through a lifelike model of the design. We’ve set up key viewpoints in the model – for example, standing at your new front entrance, or walking through the open kitchen towards the patio – so you can appreciate the transformation from multiple angles. You can also toggle design options (such as different material palettes or lighting scenes) to compare and discover what resonates most with you. This interactive visualization is both a reassurance and a thrill: reassurance that the design delivers the atmosphere and functionality you want, and the thrill of seeing your future home today. Enjoy this exploration, and feel free to note down any impressions or questions as you “walk” through the space. It’s all part of making sure the design is perfect for you.

(Technical note: For the optimal experience, use a VR headset or a device with a large screen. If you need assistance accessing the virtual tour, just let us know – we can guide you through it. This step is all about you experiencing the design firsthand, in a fun and engaging way.)

Your Investment Breakdown

Transparency is key to trust. We want you to see exactly how your investment is allocated across the different aspects of the project. In the interactive charts below, we’ve broken down the project budget for each proposal option into its major components. This way, you can easily understand where we focus our effort and resources – and how each part contributes value to the whole.

For example, you’ll notice a portion of the budget dedicated to Reality Capture & As-Built Modeling – this slice represents the work we do up front to digitally capture your existing home (scanning, surveys) and build a reliable 3D model. It’s a relatively small slice but an important one, as it lays the foundation for everything that follows with precision. You’ll also see a significant portion for Architectural Design & Documentation – this is the core creative and technical work of redesigning your home and producing all the drawings and specifications needed to build it. In Option A, there’s also a slice for Interior Design & Detailing, reflecting the inclusion of full interior design services; in Option B that slice is smaller (we coordinate with your designer), and in Option C it’s minimal or not present (interior design is by others, outside our scope). Similarly, a slice for Landscape Design appears in Options A and B, showing our work on outdoor spaces, whereas in Option C that slice is smaller since we provide only conceptual landscape input.

Each donut chart is interactive – hover over a segment to see the dollar amount and percentage for that category. You’ll find categories like “Architecture & Structure,” “Interiors,” “Landscape,” “Project Management/Coordination,” etc., each color-coded. This breakdown illustrates our value-based approach: we allocate resources to areas that directly contribute to your project’s success and your overall experience. For instance, investment in visualization and coordination reduces costly changes later; investment in design and engineering upfront ensures a smoother construction phase and higher quality outcome. No portion of your investment is wasted – every slice has a purpose tied to delivering the results you expect.

Take a moment to explore these charts for the option you’re leaning towards. They will give you a clear, big-picture overview of how the fixed fee is distributed. We’re proud to offer fixed-fee pricing because it means we take on the risk of managing hours and costs internally – you pay for results, not hours. The charts reinforce this by showing you exactly what those results entail. And if you have any questions about any segment or how we arrived at these allocations, we’re an open book. Our goal is that you feel informed and confident that your investment is being spent wisely to maximize your project’s value.

(Note: The budget allocations are based on our detailed project estimate for each option. These charts are for transparency and planning purposes – rest assured, the fixed fee you see is the cap, and we manage any overages. If the project scope remains as proposed, you will not pay a penny more than the fixed investment amount.)

Assumptions & Exclusions

We believe in clarity upfront. Below, we outline key assumptions and exclusions associated with this proposal. These are here to ensure we’re on the same page regarding what is included in our services, what conditions we’re expecting, and what falls outside the project scope (or would incur additional services). Each item can be expanded for details in the interactive version, but we’ve summarized them here for your review:

Assumptions:

We assume the existing structure of your home is fundamentally sound and suitable for the planned modifications. (If major hidden structural issues are discovered later, they may require additional services to address.)

We will receive accurate and up-to-date information about the property (such as any surveys, previous plans, or site measurements). This ensures our design and documents are based on correct data.

You, as the client, will provide timely feedback and decisions during the design process. This responsiveness allows us to maintain the project schedule and deliver the best results without unnecessary delays.

All required permits and approvals can be obtained under normal conditions. We anticipate working within standard local regulations for Ponce, PR. (If any extraordinary permitting requirements or government-imposed changes arise, we will discuss how to accommodate them.)

For Options B and C: you will engage a qualified interior designer (and/or other consultants like a landscape designer) for the portions of the project not covered by our scope. We assume those parties will collaborate with our team as needed to achieve a cohesive final product.

Exclusions:

Construction work and contractor fees: This proposal is for design and project coordination services only. The costs of construction, materials, and labor for actually building the remodel are not included. (We can help you in bidding and selecting a contractor separately, but the construction contract will be between you and the builder.)

Permitting fees and taxes: Any fees required by government agencies for permit applications, inspections, or approvals are not included in our fixed price. These will be paid directly by you to the relevant authorities.

Specialty Engineering & Consulting: Services like detailed electrical, mechanical, or geotechnical engineering, as well as specialty systems (security, audio-visual, etc.), are not included unless explicitly stated in the option’s scope. If the project requires these, they would be handled as supplemental services with separate fee agreements (we would obtain quotes and your approval before proceeding with any).

Interior design & furnishing (Options B & C): For Option B, we do not provide interior design of finishes/furniture (since your interior designer will handle it), and for Option C, no interior design services are included. That means things like selecting furniture, interior color schemes, detailed lighting fixture selection, artwork, decor, and so on are outside our scope in those options. (Option A covers interior design fully.) Similarly, procurement of furniture or fixtures is not included in any option unless specifically added.

Construction management or full-time supervision: While Option A includes basic construction phase support (site visits, consults to ensure design intent), none of the options includes day-to-day project management of the construction or a full-time site presence. Formal construction management or clerk-of-the-works services can be provided as an add-on if needed.

Anything not explicitly listed: If a service or item is not mentioned in the scope of the option you choose, you can assume it’s not included. For example, 3D interior renderings/VR are included in Option A but not in B or C; landscape planting design (detailed species selection, gardening plans) is included in A, partially in B, and not in C. We focus on what’s defined in the proposal. Any additional requests can be accommodated via a contract addendum or separate agreement as needed.

Technical Details:

Our design work will progress through standard phases (Concept Design, Design Development, Construction Documents). At each milestone, you’ll have the chance to review and approve the work, ensuring alignment before moving forward. We typically allow for a set number of revision rounds in each phase to incorporate your feedback.

Deliverables: By the end of the process, you will receive a complete set of digital (PDF) and printed drawings for the scope of work, including plans, elevations, sections, and relevant details, all ready for permit submission and construction. In Option A, this includes interior design schedules and specifications; in Option B and C, we include architectural and structural drawings (and landscape drawings as applicable). All drawings will be professionally sealed by our licensed architect/engineer as required for permits.

Coordination with consultants: If your project involves outside consultants (an interior designer in Option B/C, or any specialty engineer), our team will coordinate with them by sharing our BIM models, drawings, and requirements. We’ll conduct at least one coordination meeting (or more, as needed) to align on things like structural assumptions, MEP routes, or design interfaces. This is to ensure the final set of plans is integrated and nothing conflicts when different parts come together.

Changes and additional services: We understand projects can evolve. If you request a significant change in scope (for instance, deciding to add an extra room or a new design element not in the original plan) or need additional services beyond what’s included, we will promptly discuss any impact on timeline or fees. No extra work will be done without your approval. We’ll either consider it under supplemental services or prepare a simple change order. Our priority is to remain flexible to your needs while keeping everything transparent and agreed-upon.

Timeline: Upon approval of this proposal, we will create a detailed project schedule. As a rough guideline, the design phases (from kickoff to permit-ready plans) might span approximately X weeks for Option A (due to the broader scope, including interiors), slightly less for Option B, and less for Option C. This timeline will depend on timely feedback and any municipal approval durations. We’ll do everything in our power to meet target dates and will keep you updated at every step. Our efficient workflow (thanks to our integrated team and advanced tools) is geared toward delivering results as quickly as quality allows.

(The above assumptions, exclusions, and technical notes ensure clarity. They will be formally detailed in the contract, but we include them here so you have a complete picture now. Feel free to ask for elaboration on any point – we want you to be comfortable and informed.)
