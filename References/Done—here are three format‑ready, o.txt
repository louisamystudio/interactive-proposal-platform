Done—here are three format‑ready, one‑slide quote sheets (one per option), aligned with your value‑based model (fixed price, outcomes‑first, no hourly tables). I also generated a clean, three‑slide deck you can drop straight into the proposal:

Download the slides

Slide 1 — Option A: Fully Integrated Vision (Premium Anchor)

Fixed Investment: $187,099
What’s included (outcomes‑oriented):

Single, integrated team: Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape + full Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering coordination—one accountable studio.

Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM) for building + site; BIM federation with clash‑resolved documentation to reduce surprises.

Core visualization / VR for confident decisions and fewer late changes.

Ideal when you want maximum cohesion, speed of decisions, and single‑point accountability.

Design Services Distribution (value‑oriented, not cost‑plus):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~4% ≈ $7,484 · Building Shell ~60% ≈ $112,259 · Interior ~24% ≈ $44,904 · Landscape ~12% ≈ $22,452.
(This mirrors your integrated discipline emphasis while avoiding internal hours or margin math.)

Why this framing: A is your premium anchor and should sit near the market benchmark to set perceived value high.

Slide 2 — Option B: Collaborative Partnership

(Architecture‑led + your interior designer, Louis Bernard)
Fixed Investment: $126,636
What’s included (outcomes‑oriented):

Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing permit deliverables, authored by Louis Amy.

Design Integration & Coordination to harmonize your interior designer’s work: interfaces matrix, BIM federation, clash detection/resolution, review gates & change‑management.

Landscape Architecture authored by Louis Amy; Reality Capture baseline; core visualization for reviews.

Ideal when you want to keep a trusted interior designer while preserving architectural coherence and schedule certainty.

Design Services Distribution (illustrative):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~5% ≈ $6,332 · Building Shell ~65% ≈ $82,314 · Landscape ~12% ≈ $15,196 · Integration & Coordination ~18% ≈ $22,794 (pricing thinking & orchestration, not hours).

Why this framing: B reframes the client’s request (use their ID) as a paid integration path that protects design integrity—no internal arithmetic shown.

Slide 3 — Option C: Architectural Foundation (Core Baseline)

Fixed Investment: $87,898
What’s included (outcomes‑oriented):

Planning & permitting set; baseline BIM and coordination of core building systems.

Structural/Civil/Plumbing alignment for permits; Scan‑to‑BIM baseline.

Exclusions: Interior & Landscape authored by others; interfaces documented. Iteration caps; program changes become add‑services. (Keeps scope clear; prevents scope‑creep.)

Design Services Distribution (illustrative):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~6% ≈ $5,274 · Building Shell ~94% ≈ $82,624 (no Interiors or Landscape authoring in this tier).

Why this framing: C provides a compliant base while making client‑side coordination responsibility explicit—encouraging movement to higher‑value options.

Notes for the deck you downloaded

Each slide is built for client‑safe value framing (fixed fee per option; no hourly tables; no internal derivations).

Donut charts are included per slide to visualize discipline emphasis (not costs). This echoes your proposal UX guidance to use clean charts while keeping the story about outcomes.

Keep your standard commercial terms alongside these slides in the proposal: 20% non‑refundable kickoff deposit and 30‑day validity.

If you want, I can also append these three slides into your working proposal file or export a print‑optimized one‑pager per option.
