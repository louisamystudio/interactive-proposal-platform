Negotiation Plan: Louis Amy Engineering
The overarching strategy should be to approach conversations with a mindset of service, curiosity, and value, rather than simply pitching or selling. Focus on understanding the client's desired future state, what's getting in their way, and the impact of solving their problem.
Primary Anchor: The market-rate card and “single-team” value (Option A) Your primary anchor, the market-rate card, should be presented as the industry standard for comprehensive design services. This sets a high initial benchmark for the client's expectations regarding the value of the services. Chris Do emphasizes anchoring high in negotiations. The "single-team" value, highlighting your full in-house team and integrated design approach, should be leveraged as a superior offering that provides seamless coordination and optimal results, thereby commanding a premium. The value of your strategic thinking and clarity, which is unique to your firm, justifies a higher price point because there is less direct competition for it. This aligns with Chris Do's philosophy of value-based pricing, where the price is determined by the value to the end-user rather than just the effort involved.
Secondary Anchor: The in-house price card reinforces we’re fair and consistent The Louis Amy Price, which is slightly below market rate but still substantial, serves as a secondary anchor. This demonstrates that while your services are premium, your pricing is fair and consistent, reinforcing trust and transparency. It shows that you understand the market and are offering a competitive, yet high-value, solution based on your in-house expertise. This approach helps prevent clients from viewing your pricing as arbitrary or solely based on their wealth, a common concern with differentiated pricing.
Concession Ladder (Give/Get): When a client asks for a lower fee, Chris Do advises against reducing the price for the same work; instead, reduce the scope of deliverables and iterations. This maintains the perceived value of your services.
• If client removes Interiors → Then keep a paid coordination package (BIM federation & clash resolution across trades), with defined deliverables.
    ◦ This move separates essential strategic and coordination services (like BIM federation and clash resolution) from specific design elements. You are selling a solution and clarity, not just a deliverable. Maintaining a paid coordination package ensures that even with reduced design scope, the overall project integrity and efficiency, which are core benefits of Louis Amy Engineering, are preserved and valued.
• If client requests lower fee → Then reduce scope (deliverables and iterations), not price for the same work.
    ◦ Clearly articulate that a lower fee corresponds to a reduced scope of work. For example, fewer revisions, less detailed documentation, or a more streamlined design process. Chris Do emphasizes that a low budget signals that the project is not important, and taking such a job out of desperation leads to scope creep and feeling undervalued. By adhering to this, you avoid undervaluing your expertise and prevent future dissatisfaction due to mismatched expectations.
• If client seeks tighter schedule → Then add accelerated delivery surcharge and lock decision windows.
    ◦ Time is a precious resource. A tighter schedule increases the risk for your team and demands greater efficiency. Therefore, an accelerated delivery surcharge is justified. Crucially, establish locked decision windows for client approvals. Missed decision windows will result in pushed deadlines or additional costs, making the client accountable for their part in the accelerated schedule. This aligns with successful entrepreneurs trading their money for time.
• If client requests more visualization → Then add Visualization Pack as a priced add-on.
    ◦ Detailed visualizations, such as virtual reality immersion or advanced 3D printing models, offer significant added value and enhanced client engagement. These should be presented as supplemental services with clear pricing, rather than being absorbed into the base fee. This allows the client to choose and pay for the specific enhancements they desire, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining profitability.
Risk Reversal Elements to Consider: These elements help mitigate client concerns and build trust by shifting perceived risk away from the client.
• Defined review gates with acceptance criteria.
    ◦ Establish clear milestones for client review and approval throughout the project lifecycle, with specific acceptance criteria for each stage. This ensures that both parties are aligned on deliverables and quality, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes later on.
• Change Order Immunity framing: Our BIM + coordination reduces downstream costs (position this as a hedge, not a guarantee).
    ◦ Highlight that your advanced technologies, such as BIM and 3D laser scanning, combined with an integrated design approach, significantly reduce errors and unforeseen challenges during construction. Frame this as a strategic investment that acts as a "hedge" against costly downstream changes, offering "risk mitigation" and "peace of mind". It is important to present this as a strong likelihood based on your methodology, rather than an explicit guarantee, as guarantees often require a much higher charge to cover the substantial risk.
• Time certainty: Calendar with decision windows; missed windows push dates or add cost.
    ◦ Provide a clear project calendar outlining all key activities and, critically, client decision windows. Emphasize that adhering to these windows is vital for project progression. Missed client deadlines will either push back the overall project timeline or incur additional costs for expedited work, ensuring the client understands their role in maintaining the schedule.
Walk-away & BATNA (internal): Your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) is to maintain a minimum effective fee for "Option B" (architecture-led with coordination). If the client's fee request erodes below the cost of providing your essential coordination services, you should be prepared to walk away from the project. This signifies that you value your time and expertise, and you are not desperate for any job. Chris Do advises knowing your worth and not accepting work that compromises your value or leads to resentment.
