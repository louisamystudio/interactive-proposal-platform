Thank you for providing "Option C — Core Architecture Only (Lean baseline)" [Query]. This option effectively articulates a focused scope and a clear target client. However, as with previous options, the presentation of the "Investment (fixed)" includes a critical element that contradicts Chris Do's value-based pricing philosophy.
Here's an analysis based on Chris Do's insights:
Strengths:
1. Clear Scope Delineation and Risk Management: The scope for Option C is well-defined, with "explicit exclusions on Interiors authoring and Landscape" and "interfaces noted 'by others'" [Query]. This clear boundary setting is crucial for preventing scope creep and managing client expectations, aligning perfectly with Chris Do's advice on framing limits and charging for additional complexity. The inclusion of "Planning & permitting documents" and "baseline BIM and coordination of core building systems" still highlights Louis Amy Engineering's core value and technological capabilities [Query, 56].
2. Proactive Scope Creep Controls: "Tight caps on redesign cycles; program changes are add‑services" [Query] is an excellent implementation of Chris Do's recommendations for change management. This frames limits within the context of efficiency and protecting the client's investment and timeline, rather than sounding rigid. It also clearly defines "Additional Services" for out-of-scope changes, which is a best practice to protect profitability.
3. Strategic "Ideal When" Framing: The statement "Ideal when you want a compliant architectural foundation and will self‑manage interiors and coordination risk with your designer" [Query] is powerful. It subtly highlights the inherent value of the comprehensive coordination and interior design services offered in Options A and B by explicitly stating what the client will be responsible for in this leaner option. This aligns with the strategy of "making it harder to work with you on a lower value tier" to encourage clients towards higher-value, more integrated solutions and to ensure your premium perception is maintained.
Area for Improvement (Critical): Transparency of Internal Calculation
1. Exposing Internal Calculations: The explicit calculation: "Calculated as Option A minus Interiors authoring ($33,607.09) and Landscape ($16,238.00). (137,743.50 − 33,607.09 − 16,238.00 = 87,898.41)" [Query] is a direct contradiction of Chris Do's value-based pricing strategy.
    ◦ Chris Do's Recommendation: Chris Do strongly advises against exposing internal processes, cost breakdowns, or hourly rates to clients, as it invites negotiation based on components and effort rather than the holistic value and outcome delivered. By showing this arithmetic, you are essentially telling the client, "Here's how we arrived at this number by subtracting our internal costs for specific services," rather than, "Here's the fixed investment for the unique value and risk mitigation provided by Option C." This risks devaluing the remaining architectural and engineering services and encourages clients to unbundle your offerings further.
Recommendations for Adjustment:
1. Remove the Explicit Calculation: For all client-facing proposals, the internal calculation for "Investment (fixed)" should be entirely removed. Simply state "Investment (fixed): $87,898.41" [Query]. The justification for this price should come from the clear articulation of the scope, benefits, and the risks mitigated by Option C (and by contrast, the risks not mitigated, which fall on the client).
2. Reinforce Value for Core Services: While Option C is a leaner offering, ensure the narrative still emphasizes the premium quality, precision, and foundational value of Louis Amy Engineering's core architectural and engineering services. Frame it as the essential, high-quality base upon which any project is built, rather than merely a stripped-down version.
3. Re-evaluate Tier Anchoring: If Option A (Full Bespoke) is maintained at $137,743.50, then Option C at $87,898.41 represents a reduction of approximately $50,000. For the tiered options to effectively "anchor high" and demonstrate differentiated value, Option A should ideally be priced closer to the "Market Rate" of $187,099.00 or the "Louis Amy Price" of $183,658.00 as a premium offering. A larger perceived value gap between the tiers strengthens the positioning of the mid- and high-tier options.
By removing the internal calculation, Louis Amy Engineering can maintain a consistent value-based pricing narrative across all options, ensuring that even the most "lean" offering is perceived as a strategic investment in quality and precision.
Next Step Suggestion: Craft concise, value-based narratives for each of your three options (A, B, and C) that explain the outcome and benefits for the client at each price point, rather than focusing on what is removed or how the price is calculated. This will help transition your proposal from a cost-comparison tool to a value-driven decision guide.
