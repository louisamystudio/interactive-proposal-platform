Got it. I’ll simplify each option, bringing in all the services described in your slides so nothing is lost. Here’s the client-friendly version:

Option A – Fully Integrated Vision (Premium Anchor)

Fixed Investment: $187,099

What’s included

Architecture, Interiors, Landscape, and Engineering: One team covering architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, structural, civil, and plumbing engineering.

Reality Capture: 3D laser scanning + Scan-to-BIM for millimeter accuracy.

BIM Federation & Clash Resolution: Coordinated drawings that minimize construction surprises.

Interior Design: Space planning, lighting design, finishes, custom cabinetry, and bespoke furnishings.

Landscape & Outdoor Design: Hardscape, patios, terraces, pool, and integrated plantings.

Visualization: Photoreal renders, immersive VR (interior + exterior), and 3D printing models.

Six-Stage Process: Discovery → Creative Design → Technical Development → Pre-Construction → Construction Oversight → Observation.

Construction Oversight: Site visits, submittal reviews, RFI responses, change order evaluations, contractor payment application reviews.

Ideal when you want maximum cohesion, faster decisions, and single-point accountability for everything.

Option B – Collaborative Partnership

Fixed Investment: $126,636

What’s included

Architecture + Engineering: Louis Amy authors architecture, structural, civil, and plumbing deliverables.

Landscape by Louis Amy.

Coordination with Your Interior Designer (e.g., Louis Bernard): BIM federation, clash resolution, and integration of interior design layouts into the architecture and engineering framework.

Reality Capture: 3D scan baseline + BIM.

Visualization: Exterior VR and renders (interior visualization can be added as a supplemental service).

Six-Stage Process: From Discovery through Pre-Construction and Observation, with reviews built in.

Construction Oversight: Site visits, submittals, RFIs, change order reviews, contractor applications for payment.

Ideal when you want to keep a trusted interior designer while preserving architectural quality and schedule certainty.

Option C – Architectural Foundation (Shell & Outdoor Baseline)

Fixed Investment: $87,898

What’s included

Architecture + Engineering: Permit-level deliverables for architecture, structural, civil, and plumbing.

Reality Capture: 3D laser scanning + Scan-to-BIM baseline.

Exclusions: Interior and Landscape authored by others (Louis Amy documents only interfaces).

Visualization: Exterior only (no interior VR/renders).

Six-Stage Process: Limited to essential Discovery, Creative, and Technical steps.

Construction Oversight: Basic site and document reviews, with add-services available if scope expands.

Ideal when you need a strong architectural base and will self-manage interior/landscape design and coordination risks.

✅ Additional / Supplemental Services (available with any option):

Electrical, Mechanical, Data & Communications, Geotechnical engineering.

Specialized lighting, acoustic, energy modeling, and security design.

Surveying and project management.

FF&E procurement, specialized providers, and contractors.

All billed as fixed packages with a coordination fee for integration.

Do you want me to now re-format this into three polished one-page slides (one per option) so it matches your proposal design? That way it slots directly into your deck without needing edits.
