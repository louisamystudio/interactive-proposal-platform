Below is a polished, client‑ready **Quote Sheet** you can drop straight into the proposal. It keeps the language value‑based (no hourly tables or “savings” framing) while giving Dr. De Jesús three clear paths—including the option to collaborate with his long‑time interior designer—without sacrificing our integration standards. --- # De Jesús Residence — Quote Sheet (Design Services) **Client:** Dr. Luis De Jesús **Project:** High‑end residential remodel (approx. 6,000 sq ft) **Studio:** Louis Amy AE Studio — Integrated Architecture, Engineering, Interiors & Landscape **Date:** September 8, 2025 > We offer three modular scope options engineered to protect design integrity, reduce risk, and fit how you want to work—whether you prefer our fully integrated, in‑house team or bringing your own interior designer.&#x20; --- ## Option A — **Fully Integrated Vision** (Premium, single‑team delivery) **Scope (included)** * Architecture + Interiors + Landscape + Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering coordination * **Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM)** for millimeter‑level accuracy from day one * BIM federation & clash‑resolved documentation; core visualization for confident decisions * One accountable team, unified design language, fewer surprises through coordinated deliverables.&#x20; **Investment (fixed):** **\$137,743.50** > This reflects our comprehensive design services as currently structured for the project.&#x20; **Ideal when** you want maximum cohesion, speed of decisions, and single‑point accountability across all disciplines.&#x20; --- ## Option B — **Architecture‑Led + Your Interior Designer (Louis Bernard)** **Scope (included)** * Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering, permitting docs * **Design Integration & Coordination** to harmonize your interior designer’s work with the architecture/engineering: * BIM federation, interfaces & tolerance matrices (openings, casework envelopes, MEP rough‑ins) * Clash detection / resolution, review windows, and change‑management gateways * Finish schedules marked “by others,” with our cross‑checks for constructability and compliance. &#x20; **Investment (fixed):** **\$126,636.41** > Calculated as Option A minus in‑house Interiors authoring **(\$33,607.09)** + a fixed **Integration & Coordination package (\$22,500)** that prices thinking/oversight—not hours. (137,743.50 − 33,607.09 + 22,500 = 126,636.41). Fixed‑fee coordination aligns with value‑based pricing and avoids hourly tables. &#x20; **Ideal when** you’d like to keep a trusted designer while preserving architectural coherence, technical integrity, and schedule certainty.&#x20; --- ## Option C — **Core Architecture Only** (Lean baseline) **Scope (included)** * Planning & permitting documents; baseline BIM and coordination of core building systems * Explicit **exclusions** on Interiors authoring and Landscape; interfaces noted “by others.” * Tight caps on redesign cycles; program changes are add‑services.&#x20; **Investment (fixed):** **\$87,898.41** > Calculated as Option A minus Interiors authoring **(\$33,607.09)** and Landscape **(\$16,238.00)**. (137,743.50 − 33,607.09 − 16,238.00 = 87,898.41).&#x20; **Ideal when** you want a compliant architectural foundation and will self‑manage interiors and coordination risk with your designer.&#x20; --- ### What’s Inside Our Integrated Delivery (applies wherever included) * **BIM + Coordination:** clash‑free docs to minimize downstream change orders. * **Reality Capture (LiDAR/Photogrammetry):** “survey‑grade truth” to de‑risk surprises. * **Visualization & VR:** decide with confidence before building. * **In‑house disciplines:** architecture, interiors, landscape, and engineering coordination for a seamless, single‑team experience.&#x20; --- ## Optional Enhancements (Add‑ons) * **Visualization Packs** — Light / Standard / Premium: calibrated to decision velocity and review needs (photoreal imagery, VR walk‑through, optional large‑format 3D prints). Priced as fixed packages.&#x20; * **Acceleration Surcharge** — if a compressed schedule is required, with locked decision windows.&#x20; --- ## Interfaces & Coordination Gateways (all tiers using your ID) When an external interior designer is involved (Option B/C), we implement: * **Interfaces Matrix:** clear hand‑offs, who‑owns‑what, and tolerances; * **BIM submission & review windows** with change‑management rules; * **Fee‑scope coupling:** specialty complexity (custom millwork, wellness rooms, specialty lighting) uplifts the fee or moves to add‑services. These controls preserve design integrity and reduce risk.&#x20; --- ## Commercial Terms * **Kickoff Deposit:** 20% non‑refundable at acceptance; monthly progress billing thereafter. &#x20; * **Proposal Validity:** Prices and scope valid for **30 days**; thereafter we re‑baseline to ensure alignment with current conditions and resource availability. &#x20; * **Decision Windows & Changes:** Iteration caps per scope; decisions outside agreed windows may shift dates or incur resequencing fees; out‑of‑scope changes are billed as add‑services.&#x20; --- ## Acceptance & Next Steps 1. **Select your option** (A, B, or C) and accept the proposal. 2. **Remit the 20% kickoff** to reserve studio time. 3. **Kickoff Meeting:** we schedule your Discovery session, confirm interfaces (if using your interior designer), and lock the initial review calendar.&#x20; --- ### Notes on Pricing Logic (for our internal consistency, not client‑facing) * Option A reflects the current comprehensive scope for this commission. * Option B is **scope‑reframed, not discounted**: we remove Interiors authoring, then add a **fixed Integration & Coordination** package to protect outcomes with an external interior designer. &#x20; * Option C provides a compliance‑oriented baseline while making the added client effort/coordination trade‑offs explicit.&#x20; --- If you’d like this formatted as a one‑page, print‑ready sheet for your proposal PDF, say the word and I’ll output it exactly in that layout.
