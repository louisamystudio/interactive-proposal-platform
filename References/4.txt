Architectural Value: The Casa Vista Proposal
(Saved responses are view only)
Louis Amy AE Studio's current proposal, exemplified by the "Casa Vista" project, is designed to provide comprehensive architectural and engineering services for a high-end residential remodel in Ponce, Puerto Rico [Query, 239]. The proposal effectively presents a "client-safe" view, emphasizing value and results while strategically obscuring internal cost calculations.
Current Proposal: Client-Safe View ("Casa Vista")
The "Casa Vista" project details a 4,407 sq ft custom residence remodel in Ponce [Query]. Key elements visible to the client include:
1. Executive Investment Summary:
    ◦ Your Contract Price (design services): $137,744 [Query, 175, 290]. This is the final price presented to the client.
    ◦ Market Rate: $187,099 [Query, 175, 290]. This figure represents the industry standard cost for similar services.
    ◦ In-House Market Price: $183,658 [Query, 175, 290]. This indicates the firm's calculated price based on its integrated in-house expertise before any discounts.
    ◦ Displayed Savings vs. Market: $49,356 [Query, 175, 290]. The proposal highlights a significant saving for the client, positioning Louis Amy as offering "Exceptional Value".
2. Project Overview:
    ◦ Building Area: 4,407 sq ft existing [Query, 284]. The overall remodel target cost is $195.00 per sq ft.
    ◦ Site Area: 972 m² total site [Query, 284].
    ◦ Cost-per-sf Assumptions: For this project, the remodel target is $195.00 per sq ft, leading to a Construction Budget Envelope.
3. Construction Budget Envelope: The total remodel budget is estimated between ~$0.8M–$0.9M, derived from the dashboard’s minimum and target per-square-foot ranges [Query, 284]. Specifically, the project overview shows a total budget of $859,365.
4. Budget Distribution: The total construction budget is allocated across different aspects of the project [Query, 284]:
    ◦ Shell Budget: $567,181 (66% of total).
    ◦ Interior Budget: $189,060 (22% of total).
    ◦ Landscape Budget: $103,124 (12% of total).
5. Design Services Distribution: The design fee is broken down by category, highlighting the integrated nature of the firm's services [Query, 176, 289]:
    ◦ Scan to BIM: 4% ($5,344).
    ◦ Building Shell (Architecture, Structural, Civil, Plumbing): 60% ($82,554).
    ◦ Interior Design: 24% ($33,607).
    ◦ Landscape Architecture: 12% ($16,238).
    ◦ The proposal explicitly lists services included and their amounts, such as Architecture ($49,433.93), Interior Design ($33,607.09), Landscape Architecture ($15,893.78), Structural Engineer ($9,647.51), Civil / Site Engineer ($5,357.60), and Plumbing Engineer ($4,441.27), indicating these are handled "In-House".
6. Other Sections: The proposal includes information on Technology & Craft, Assumptions, Exclusions, Owner Responsibilities, and clear Terms & Next Steps [Query]. It specifies that the proposal is valid for 30 days. The document also emphasizes "Why Choose Louis Amy Engineering?" highlighting exceptional value, a full in-house team, an integrated design approach, and a proven track record.
Crucially, the client view intentionally excludes internal levers such as detailed hours, individual team member rates, project margin, and the full breakdown of top-down versus bottom-up fee analysis [Query, 177, 288]. This maintains focus on the value and outcome for the client.
Our Quoting Method: How the Numbers are Arrived At
Louis Amy Engineering's quoting method integrates several inputs and logical steps to arrive at the final client-facing price, prioritizing a value-based pricing structure.
1. Inputs & Logic (High Level):
    ◦ Scope/Type: The initial input is the project type, such as a private residence remodel [Query].
    ◦ Area & Per-sf Cost: The building area (e.g., 4,407 sq ft) and the per-square-foot cost targets (e.g., $195.00 for remodel) are used to determine the overall Construction Budget Envelope and subsequently, the category allocations (Shell, Interior, Landscape) [Query, 174, 284].
    ◦ Discipline Allocation: The design fee is strategically distributed across various disciplines: Architecture, Interiors, Landscape, Structural/MEP coordination, and Reality Capture/Visualization [Query, 175, 176, 285]. This distribution reflects the complexity and scope of work for each specialized area, with most core services being "In-House".
    ◦ Sanity Bounds: An internal engine performs a "Sanity Check" by comparing the calculated fee against the construction budget (as a percentage of the total budget) and market heuristics [Query, 177, 288]. This dual analysis, combining a "Top-Down Fee Analysis" (market-based fee from construction budget and industry-standard fee curves) and a "Bottom-Up Fee Analysis" (detailed hours-based calculation using team member rates and estimated hours), ensures the proposed fee is competitive and profitable. However, the internal sliders and detailed hourly calculations are kept separate from the client presentation [Query].
    ◦ Commercial Terms: The standard commercial terms include a 20% non-refundable kickoff deposit, monthly progress billing, and a 30-day proposal validity [Query, Firm Executive Summary, 180].
2. Client-Safe Output: The result of this method is a clear, fixed design fee total, a construction budget envelope, detailed allocation charts for design services, and explicit assumptions, exclusions, and terms [Query]. This approach allows for a confident decision by the client without overwhelming them with internal financial mechanics [Query].
Connection to Chris Do's Principles
Louis Amy AE Studio's approach aligns with several of Chris Do's core business and pricing philosophies:
• Value-Based Pricing over Hourly Rates: The proposal clearly demonstrates value-based pricing by presenting a final contract price that is significantly below market rates, highlighting a saving of over $45,000. Chris Do emphasizes that successful businesses charge based on the value delivered to the client, not the hours spent. He argues that hourly billing punishes efficiency and expertise, and Louis Amy avoids this by presenting a fixed project fee for its comprehensive services.
• Focus on Outcomes and Transformation: The studio emphasizes "Exceptional Outcomes" and "creating spaces that inspire". This aligns with Chris Do's teaching that clients "buy based on emotions not on facts" and that effective selling focuses on the desired future state and the impact on the client, not just the features of the service. The value proposition of minimizing change orders through BIM and providing "survey-grade truth from day one" also translates directly into tangible benefits for the client, such as reduced risk and peace of mind [Query, 254, 282, 283].
• Strategic Positioning and Niche Specialization: Louis Amy positions itself as a premium, design-led practice for High-Net-Worth (HNW) clients who value precision, privacy, and craft [Query, Firm Executive Summary]. This targeted approach allows the firm to "command a premium" and attract a "different kind of buyer". Chris Do consistently advocates for niching down to establish expertise and reduce price competition.
• Transparency (Controlled) and Trust Building: While internal financial levers are not disclosed, the proposal offers a comparative pricing structure (Market Rate vs. Louis Amy Price vs. Final Contract Price) that subtly builds trust by demonstrating value and potential savings. Chris Do notes that building trust and rapport are critical in the sales process.
• Confidence in Pricing: The firm presents a substantial price with a clear justification of value, indicating confidence in its services. Chris Do stresses the importance of believing in one's premium and being bold enough to state one's worth, which attracts a different kind of client.
• "Manufacturing Problems" (or Identifying Needs): The detailed sections on client's vision, wishlist, and desired outcomes (e.g., spatial organization, indoor-outdoor connection, materials & maintenance) reflect an in-depth understanding of the client's needs. Chris Do advises "manufacturing problems" or identifying significant issues the client cares about, which then allows for proposing high-value solutions.
In summary, the Louis Amy AE Studio proposal effectively communicates its advanced technological capabilities, integrated design, and client-centric approach, leveraging these as differentiators to justify its premium, value-based pricing for a discerning clientele, in line with modern sales and branding strategies.
