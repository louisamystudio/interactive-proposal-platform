Option B – Architectural & Engineering Design with Interior Integration: architecture, structural, civil, plumbing, landscape and BIM, plus interior design coordination with your chosen designer.
Option B – Architectural & Engineering Design with Interior Integration
Your Strategic Investment in Partnership and Precision

This option is designed for clients who wish to engage a trusted interior designer while still benefiting from Louis Amy Engineering’s expertise. We provide comprehensive architectural and engineering services and act as your central design integrator, coordinating seamlessly with your chosen interior designer to protect the integrity of the overall vision.

Project Overview

Total Construction Budget: $859,365 for a 4,407 sq ft remodel【1†L5-L15】. Our scope encompasses the building shell, structural systems, civil and plumbing engineering, and careful integration of interior elements designed by your selected collaborator.

Scope of Work: We deliver the full architectural and engineering package—architecture, structural, civil/site, plumbing, and landscape design—while collaborating with your interior designer to ensure their concepts align with the structural and technical requirements of the project【1†L126-L134】.

Coordination Role: Louis Amy Engineering serves as the project’s conductor, reviewing your interior designer’s plans, advising on compatibility with the structural and mechanical systems, and managing revisions to avoid costly conflicts.

Your Investment

Investment Amount: $107,497

This figure is calculated by removing the direct interior design service from Option A and adding a modest fee for our Interior Design Integration & Coordination service. You still enjoy the benefits of a single point of accountability and risk mitigation as we harmonize all disciplines, but your interior designer leads the creative direction of the living spaces. The fee reflects the value of preventing schedule delays, design clashes, and expensive rework.

Services Included

Architecture – Complete design of the building shell, structural layout, exterior finishes, and spatial planning.

Structural Engineering – Detailed engineering ensuring safety and compliance with building codes.

Civil / Site Engineering – Integration with site topography, drainage, and grading for a harmonious footprint.

Plumbing Engineering – Efficient, reliable design of water and waste systems.

Landscape Architecture – Designing outdoor environments that enhance the home’s experience and value.

Scan to BIM (Building & Site) – High‑precision reality capture to inform design decisions【1†L126-L134】.

Interior Design Integration & Coordination – Acting as the liaison between Louis Amy and your interior designer, reviewing their drawings for technical compatibility, and ensuring the overall vision remains cohesive.

Why Choose Option B?

Freedom with Guidance: You retain the freedom to work with a trusted interior designer while still benefiting from our integrated coordination and risk management.

Reduced Risk: We safeguard the project by identifying conflicts between disciplines early, saving time and money.

Continuous Alignment: Our team maintains the aesthetic and functional intent of the architecture while incorporating the interior designer’s contributions into the BIM model.

Peace of Mind: You enjoy a streamlined process without having to personally manage multiple design teams.

Next Steps

Select Your Interior Designer: Confirm your chosen interior designer and share their contact information so we can begin collaboration.

Approve the Proposal: Sign off on this option to secure the investment value and initiate the integration process.

Kick‑off Coordination Meeting: Schedule a joint meeting with all stakeholders to align expectations and establish communication protocols.

Option B offers a balanced approach—empowering you to collaborate with your preferred designer while ensuring Louis Amy Engineering protects the project’s integrity and delivers a cohesive, technically sound result.

Option C – Core Architectural & Engineering Foundations: essential architecture, structural, civil, plumbing and BIM services only, leaving interior and landscape design and coordination to you or future consultants.
Option C – Core Architectural & Engineering Foundations
Your Essential Investment in Structure and Compliance

Option C is for clients seeking a cost‑effective solution focused on the essentials—meeting regulatory requirements and establishing a solid foundation for construction. This approach provides the minimum necessary design services to move your project forward, leaving aesthetic decisions and coordination to you or future consultants.

Project Overview

Total Construction Budget: $859,365 for a 4,407 sq ft remodel【1†L5-L15】. Under this option we address only those elements necessary for permitting and structural integrity.

Scope of Work: We provide architectural plans, structural engineering, civil/site engineering, and plumbing engineering. Interior design, landscape architecture, and coordination with external designers are not included. Reality‑capture services ensure that our base drawings are accurate and ready for construction.

Your Investment

Investment Amount: $88,243

This investment represents a pared‑down scope. By excluding interior design and landscape architecture, you take on responsibility for coordinating these elements and ensuring aesthetic consistency. The fee reflects our role in delivering code‑compliant plans and robust engineering while omitting the premium associated with full integration and coordination.

Services Included

Architecture – Development of plans and elevations necessary for permitting and core spatial layout.

Structural Engineering – Detailed calculations and drawings to guarantee safety and compliance.

Civil / Site Engineering – Grading, drainage, and site integration with municipal requirements.

Plumbing Engineering – Design of water supply and waste disposal systems.

Scan to BIM (Building & Site) – High‑precision documentation of existing conditions to inform our design【1†L126-L134】.

What’s Not Included

Interior Design & Finishes – Creative and functional planning of interiors, selection of materials, and aesthetic coordination.

Landscape Architecture – Outdoor design and integration with the natural environment.

Design Coordination with External Consultants – Management of other designers’ drawings and integration into the architectural and engineering documents.

Considerations

Higher Coordination Responsibility: You (or your builder) will need to manage and coordinate interior and landscape design elements, which can introduce delays and conflicts if not handled carefully.

Limited Aesthetic Integration: The core package ensures compliance and functionality but does not guarantee a cohesive visual experience across all spaces.

Future Upgrades: Interior and landscape services can be added later as separate packages, but integrating them after construction starts may increase costs and complexity.

Next Steps

Review Scope: Confirm that a compliance‑focused design meets your immediate goals and budget constraints.

Approve the Proposal: Sign off on this option to authorise us to begin architectural and engineering work.

Plan for Interiors/Landscape: If you intend to engage designers for interiors or landscape in the future, consider how coordination will be managed to avoid rework.

Option C provides the essentials to get your project designed and permitted, offering a cost‑efficient starting point. If you seek the assurance of a unified vision and fully integrated delivery, we encourage you to consider the advantages outlined in Options A and B.
