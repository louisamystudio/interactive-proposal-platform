De Jesús Residence — Quote Sheet (Design Services)

Client: Dr. Luis De Jesús
Project: High‑end residential remodel (approx. 6,000 sq ft)
Studio: Louis Amy AE Studio — Integrated Architecture, Engineering, Interiors & Landscape
Date: September 8, 2025

We offer three modular scope options engineered to protect design integrity, reduce risk, and match how you prefer to work—whether you choose our fully integrated, in‑house team or bring your long‑time interior designer.

Option A — Fully Integrated Vision (Premium, single‑team delivery)

Scope (included)

Architecture + Interiors + Landscape + Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering coordination

Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM) for millimeter‑level accuracy from day one

BIM federation & clash‑resolved documentation; core visualization for confident decisions

One accountable team, unified design language, fewer surprises through coordinated deliverables

Investment (fixed): $137,743.50

Ideal when you want maximum cohesion, faster decisions, and single‑point accountability across all disciplines.

Option B — Architecture‑Led + Your Interior Designer (Louis Bernard)

Scope (included)

Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering; permitting documents

Design Integration & Coordination to harmonize your interior designer’s work with the architecture/engineering:

BIM federation, interfaces & tolerance matrices (openings, casework envelopes, MEP rough‑ins)

Clash detection / resolution, scheduled review windows, and change‑management gateways

Finish schedules marked “by others,” with our cross‑checks for constructability and compliance

Investment (fixed): $126,636.41

Ideal when you’d like to keep a trusted designer while preserving architectural coherence, technical integrity, and schedule certainty.

Option C — Core Architecture Only (Lean baseline)

Scope (included)

Planning & permitting documents; baseline BIM and coordination of core building systems

Explicit exclusions on Interiors authoring and Landscape; interfaces noted “by others”

Tight caps on redesign cycles; program changes are add‑services

Investment (fixed): $87,898.41

Ideal when you want a compliant architectural foundation and will self‑manage interiors and the associated coordination risk with your designer.

What’s Inside Our Integrated Delivery (applies wherever included)

BIM + Coordination: clash‑resolved documentation to minimize downstream change orders

Reality Capture (LiDAR/Photogrammetry): “survey‑grade truth” to de‑risk surprises

Visualization & VR: decide with confidence before building

In‑house disciplines: architecture, interiors, landscape, and engineering coordination for a seamless, single‑team experience

Optional Enhancements (Add‑ons)

Visualization Packs — Light / Standard / Premium: calibrated to decision velocity (photoreal imagery, VR walk‑through; optional large‑format 3D prints). Fixed‑fee packages.

Acceleration Surcharge — for compressed schedules with locked decision windows.

Interfaces & Coordination Gateways (when collaborating with your interior designer)

Interfaces Matrix: clear hand‑offs, responsibilities, and tolerances

BIM submission & review windows with change‑management rules

Fee‑scope coupling: specialty complexity (custom millwork, wellness rooms, specialty lighting) uplifts the fee or moves to add‑services

Commercial Terms

Kickoff Deposit: 20% non‑refundable at acceptance; monthly progress billing thereafter

Proposal Validity: Prices and scope valid for 30 days; thereafter we re‑baseline to ensure alignment with current conditions and resource availability

Decision Windows & Changes: Iteration caps per scope; decisions outside agreed windows may shift dates or incur resequencing fees; out‑of‑scope changes are billed as add‑services

Acceptance & Next Steps

Select your option (A, B, or C) and accept the proposal.

Remit the 20% kickoff to reserve studio time.

Kickoff Meeting: schedule Discovery, confirm interfaces (if using your interior designer), and lock the initial review calendar.

Internal note — keep private (source alignment)

Client‑facing quotes should avoid hourly tables, hour breakdowns, “savings” framing, and internal arithmetic; lead with fixed, value‑based investments and outcome language.

If you want Option A to act as a true premium anchor, you can present it at the Market Rate ($187,099) or Louis‑Amy benchmark ($183,658) and re‑spread B/C accordingly; the $137,744 figure is the current final integrated price in the client‑safe materials.

When the client brings their own ID, keep Design Integration & Coordination as a clearly defined, fixed service—charging for strategy, interfaces, and risk mitigation, not hours.

Proof points that resonate (BIM, LiDAR/photogrammetry, VR, integrated disciplines) should stay prominent across all tiers.
