Based on Chris Do's insights and recommendations, the key to fixing the fee quote part of your proposal is to shift entirely from an "effort-based" or "cost-comparison" mindset to a "value-based" and "outcomes-focused" approach. This means removing all mentions of hourly rates, detailed hour breakdowns, internal fee analyses, and direct "savings" messaging, as these elements can undermine the perceived value of your premium services and invite clients to negotiate on effort rather than outcome.
Here is the copy-paste content to revise the fee quote section of your Louis Amy Engineering proposal, structured to align with Chris Do's philosophy:

Summary of Changes and Rationale:
1. Eliminated Hourly Rates and Hour Breakdowns: All detailed "Fee Analysis," "Project Phases & Hours Distribution," "Sanity Check," and the "Hourly Fee Table" slides or sections from the original proposal should be entirely removed from the client-facing document. Chris Do vehemently argues against hourly billing because it measures effort, not value, and punishes efficiency. These are internal tools, not client value propositions.
2. Replaced "Total Savings" with Value Framing: The phrase "Total Savings: $45,914.50" has been removed. Instead, the language now emphasizes the "Strategic Investment," "Legacy Home," "Unparalleled Vision & Peace of Mind," and the "Value" and "Transformation" delivered. Chris Do advises framing the investment around the value created and the desired future state, rather than a discount that positions your service as a commodity.
3. Reframed Service Listing: While the list of included services remains, specific dollar amounts for each service within the client-facing proposal are removed. This prevents clients from trying to "unbundle" or nitpick individual service costs and reinforces the holistic, integrated value of your combined expertise.
4. Value-Based Language for All Sections: The new copy consistently uses terms like "strategic investment," "unparalleled precision," "peace of mind," "transformed future," "seamless experience," and "legacy home" to align with what HNW clients value most.
5. Fixed Fees for Supplemental Services: Billing for "Supplemental Services" is changed from "Cost + 15% Fee" and an hourly table to "clearly defined, fixed-fee packages" with coordination bundled. This maintains a value-based approach even for additional services.
6. Action-Oriented Next Steps: The closing has been made more assertive and action-oriented, prompting the client for immediate e-signature and scheduling of a kick-off meeting, which compresses the decision cycle and reinforces commitment.
This revised content for the fee quote section will present Louis Amy Engineering as a premium, value-driven partner, focusing the client's attention on the transformative outcomes and integrated expertise, rather than cost or effort.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Step Suggestion: To further solidify this value-based approach, practice articulating the unique benefits of each integrated service (Architecture, Engineering, Interior Design, Reality Capture) in terms of "peace of mind," "risk mitigation," and "precision" without reverting to hourly costs. This can be done by role-playing client objections about perceived cost.
