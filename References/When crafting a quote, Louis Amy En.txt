When crafting a quote, Louis Amy Engineering should strategically present numbers to emphasize value, outcomes, and transformation for the client, while explicitly avoiding detailed internal cost breakdowns or hourly rates. Chris Do's philosophy advocates for a value-based pricing model that focuses on the client's desired future state and the impact of the services, rather than the effort involved. Here’s a breakdown of what numbers to include and how to present them, aligned with Chris Do's insights: 1. The Core Principle: Fixed, Value-Based Investment • What to include: A single, clear "Final Contract Price" for each option offered. This fixed fee represents the total investment for the outcome and value delivered, not the sum of hours or costs. • How to frame it: Present this as an "Investment" that secures the client's vision and delivers specific, desirable outcomes (e.g., "Your Investment for a Legacy Home," "Delivering Unparalleled Value: [Final Contract Price]"). 2. Tiered Options for Perceived Value and Anchoring • What to include: Three distinct pricing options (e.g., Option A: Full Bespoke, Option B: Collaborative Partnership, Option C: Core Architecture Only), each with its own fixed price. ◦ High-Value Anchor (Option A - Full Bespoke): Position the highest-priced option first, representing the maximum possible value and transformative outcome. This sets a high initial benchmark for the client's perception of value. ◦ Optimal Value (Option B - Collaborative Partnership): This would be your firm's "Louis Amy Price," representing the ideal blend of expertise and value, typically slightly below the highest anchor. ◦ Contextual Contrast (Option C - Core Architecture Only): This is the lowest-scope, lowest-priced option, serving to make the mid- and high-tier options appear more attractive and to highlight the value of services excluded. • How to frame it: Clearly delineate the scope and unique benefits of each option. For the lowest tier, subtly highlight the increased client responsibility or potential challenges due to the reduced scope, which implicitly encourages moving to higher-value options. 3. Strategic Comparison Points (Controlled Transparency) • What to include: ◦ Market Rate: Display the "Industry Standard" or "Market Rate" as a benchmark. ◦ Louis Amy Price (Internal Benchmark): Include your firm's calculated "In-House Expertise" price. • How to frame it: Use these as secondary points to validate Louis Amy Engineering's premium positioning and to demonstrate that even with superior service, your firm offers "exceptional value". The emphasis should not be on "Total Savings" as a discount, but rather on the value delivered at the "Final Contract Price" relative to these benchmarks. 4. Construction Budget Overview • What to include: ◦ Total Project Budget: The estimated overall budget for the construction project. ◦ Budget Distribution: High-level percentages and dollar amounts allocated to major categories like "Shell Budget," "Interior Budget," and "Landscape Budget". • How to frame it: Present this information visually (e.g., using interactive donut charts) to provide clear context for the design fees and demonstrate thoughtful financial planning. This shows the client where their total construction investment is focused. 5. Design Services Distribution (Value-Oriented) • What to include: A breakdown of the design fee by major service categories (e.g., Scan to BIM, Building Shell, Interior, Landscape), indicating percentages and associated dollar amounts. This focuses on the different disciplines involved. • How to frame it: This distribution should highlight the integrated nature of Louis Amy Engineering's services and how each component contributes to the holistic design and successful outcome. This is an opportunity to show the scope of professional expertise without detailing internal costs. 6. Supplemental Services (as Priced Add-ons) • What to include: For services like specialized engineering (e.g., Geotechnical) or advanced visualization, present these as separate, fixed-fee "add-ons". • How to frame it: Frame these as opportunities to elevate the project or mitigate further risks, linking them to specific benefits rather than just costs. Avoid "Cost + 15% Fee" language and explicit hourly tables. Instead, bundle consultant costs with Louis Amy's coordination fee into a single, value-based fixed price for the supplemental service. Explicit Exclusions (Crucial for Value-Based Pricing) Do NOT include the following in client-facing proposals: • Hourly Rates: No "Hourly Fee Table" or mentions of average hourly rates. Chris Do vehemently argues that hourly billing measures effort, not value, and punishes efficiency. • Hours Breakdowns: Remove "Project Phases & Hours Distribution" and "Fee Analysis" by hours or individual team members. This exposes internal processes and invites clients to negotiate based on time, not value. • Internal Calculations: Do not show how a price is derived by subtracting internal costs (e.g., "Calculated as Option A minus Interiors authoring...") [Query]. This devalues services and encourages unbundling based on perceived cost, not value. • Detailed Profit Margins: Avoid disclosing internal profit margins. By adhering to these principles, Louis Amy Engineering can present quotes that resonate with clients by focusing on the value, outcomes, and peace of mind they are purchasing, rather than the effort or cost. Next Step Suggestion: Review your current proposal documents and identify all instances where internal financial mechanics (like hourly rates or detailed hour breakdowns) are exposed. Prioritize their removal and replacement with value-oriented language and fixed pricing for services and add-ons. prepare the quotes options
