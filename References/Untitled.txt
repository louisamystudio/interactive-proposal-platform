Got it. I’ve studied your dummy app and the uploaded market/cost analysis docs. Here’s a strategic plan for the client-facing quotation page—a luxury, persuasive presentation layer that visualizes your backend data without exposing internal math or sensitive margins.

🎯 Core Principles

Sell the Result, Not the Hours
Internally you calculate time, multipliers, and cost indices. Externally, clients see outcomes: bespoke design, integrated services, precision, and technology.

Luxury Positioning
The UI must feel like a high-end proposal: editorial white space, minimal typography, cinematic images, elegant data visualizations.

Transparency Without Overexposure
Break down services and costs at a category level (e.g., “Architecture & Engineering,” “Landscape Design,” “Technology Integration”), not raw hourly factors.
Show construction cost ranges as budgets, not line-by-line contractor numbers.

📐 Page Layout Plan
1. Hero Section: Vision + Value

Full-width architectural rendering or conceptual mood image.

Tagline: “A bespoke architectural journey tailored to your lifestyle.”

Subtext: “We design timeless spaces with uncompromising detail, powered by advanced technology and decades of expertise.”

2. Service Breakdown (Engaging Tiles + Icons)

Instead of a spreadsheet, use modular cards with icons + micro-descriptions:

Architectural Design – Concept to construction drawings.

Engineering Services – Structural, MEP, resilience-driven solutions.

Interior Architecture – Custom finishes, detailing, material curation.

Landscape & Outdoor Living – Pools, gardens, terraces.

Technology & Visualization – VR/AR immersion, 3D printing, BIM.

👉 Each tile should include:

A % share of total professional services (visualized with a circular progress bar).

A subtle cost band (e.g., “$XXk – $YYk”).

3. Construction Budget Visualization

Clients want to grasp where their money goes:

Use stacked bar or waterfall charts:

Shell (structure, envelope)

Interiors (finishes, fixtures)

Landscape & Outdoor

Show min–target–max ranges (not a single hard number).

Add context: “These ranges reflect Puerto Rico’s current construction market, with luxury builds typically between $X and $Y per sq.ft”.

4. Project Timeline (Elegant Infographic)

Horizontal timeline with phases: Vision → Design → Technical → Procurement → Construction Support.

Add subtle durations (months).

Reinforce that each step is carefully managed for precision.

5. Value Statement Section

A modern split-screen:

Left: image (e.g., VR goggles, drone scan, 3D printer).

Right: Text:

“Why Louis Amy AE Studio?”

Bullet points:

Virtual reality immersion for design clarity.

Nvidia-accelerated rendering for photorealistic previews.

Survey-grade LiDAR + drone mapping for absolute precision.

Bespoke 3D-printed models of your home.

6. Luxury Benchmark Comparison (Optional Add-On)

Position the project against market context:

Graph or map with current luxury build benchmarks in PR (Rincón, Aguadilla, Isabela, Dorado).

Shows client their project aligns with $1.5M+ bespoke custom builds for HNW individuals.

7. Closing Section: Call to Engagement

Headline: “Let’s bring your vision to life with precision and artistry.”

Button: “Schedule a Private Design Session” (CTA instead of “Accept Quote”).

Small print: “All budgets and services shown are preliminary ranges and refined through collaborative design.”

🎨 Style Guide

Typography: Serif headline (luxury feel) + modern sans-serif body.

Palette: White / deep charcoal / bronze accent.

Charts: Minimalist, thin lines, transparent fills—avoid “Excel look.”

Motion: Subtle animations (tiles fade in, progress bars load smoothly).

Layout Inspiration: Dwell Magazine + Apple product pages.

Would you like me to draft wireframes (Figma-style sketches) of this client-facing page, or should I directly prepare the React/Tailwind component code (styled like your dummy site but adapted for client presentation)?

It appears that the Replit-hosted page you shared is blocked in this environment, so I wasn’t able to view it directly. Based on your description of its content and the goals you outlined, here’s a comprehensive plan for a high‑end, client‑facing quotation page that preserves confidentiality while conveying value and sophistication.

1. Lead with Vision and Value

Hero section: Use a full‑width aspirational rendering or conceptual mood image with a succinct headline (e.g., “Designing Timeless Spaces Tailored to Your Lifestyle”). Subtext should emphasize bespoke craftsmanship and advanced technology.

Outcome‑focused messaging: Frame the proposal around what your clients gain—beauty, functionality, peace of mind—rather than the hours of work behind it.

2. Structured Service Breakdown

Modular cards: Present each service as an elegant card with an icon and a short description (e.g., Architectural Design, Engineering Services, Interior Architecture, Landscape & Outdoor Living, Technology & Visualization). Highlight the value of each service, not the internal calculations.

Cost visibility: For each card, show only a percentage share of total professional service fees (via circular charts or progress bars) and a cost range (e.g., “$80k–$110k”) rather than line‑by‑line numbers.

3. Construction Budget Visualization

Stacked bar or waterfall chart: Illustrate how the overall construction budget is allocated—showing ranges for structure, interiors, exterior/landscape, etc.—so clients grasp the relative investment without seeing specific contractor quotes.

Contextual note: Provide a brief explanation about regional cost ranges and the bespoke nature of their project (e.g., typical high‑end builds in Puerto Rico fall within a certain price per square foot).

4. Project Timeline Infographic

Lay out project phases (Vision → Design → Technical → Procurement → Construction Support) in a horizontal timeline, with approximate durations.

Use discrete milestones or icons to show progress and reassure clients of a structured, well‑managed process.

5. Value Proposition Section

Why choose your studio: Highlight differentiators such as VR/AR visualization, survey‑grade drone mapping, 3D printing of models, an experienced team, and Nvidia‑accelerated rendering. Pair text with evocative imagery (e.g., a designer using VR goggles or a 3D printer in action).

Quality and technology: Explain that while your fees reflect the complexity and time invested, they enable industry‑leading tools and a meticulous approach to achieve extraordinary results.

6. (Optional) Market Benchmark Comparison

If appropriate, include a tasteful chart or map comparing typical budgets for bespoke high‑end homes in regions like Rincón, Dorado, and other luxury markets. This helps clients see where their project stands without revealing internal formulas.

7. Call to Engagement

Conclude with a warm, confidence‑inspiring invitation (“Let’s bring your vision to life with precision and artistry”), followed by a clear call‑to‑action button such as “Schedule a Private Design Session.”

Note that all budgets and services shown are preliminary ranges to be refined collaboratively.

8. Styling and User Experience

Typography: Combine a classic serif for headlines with a modern sans serif for body text to evoke sophistication.

Color palette: Use whites and charcoals accented with metallic tones (e.g., bronze or gold) for understated elegance.

Minimalism: Maintain generous white space, thin chart lines, and subtle animations for a premium feel.

Interactivity: Allow clients to hover over charts to see ranges or details; ensure all animations and interactions are smooth and polished.

This structure balances transparency with exclusivity, communicates value without exposing sensitive calculations, and appeals to high‑net‑worth clients seeking bespoke architectural services. Let me know if you’d like any wireframes, design mockups, or code components based on this plan.

Proposed Client‑Facing Quotation Page

Hero Section: Aspirational Vision

Full‑width architectural rendering or mood image with a refined tagline (“Designing timeless spaces tailored to your lifestyle”) and subtext.

Brief value promise: emphasise bespoke craftsmanship and advanced technology.

Service Breakdown: Modular Cards

Use clean, icon‑based cards for each service: Architectural Design, Engineering Services, Interior Architecture, Landscape & Outdoor Living, Technology & Visualization.

For each card, show the percentage share of total professional fees as a circular graphic and provide a cost range; avoid exposing internal calculations.

Construction Budget Visualization

Incorporate interactive stacked bar or waterfall charts showing budget ranges for major categories (shell/structure, interiors/finishes, sitework/landscape). Present minimum, target and maximum ranges without revealing specific contractor quotes.

Provide brief explanatory text linking the ranges to current market conditions.

Project Timeline

A horizontal timeline diagram showing phases: Vision, Design, Technical, Procurement, Construction Support. Include approximate durations and milestones for clarity and assurance.

Value Proposition & Technology

Highlight differentiators such as VR/AR design previews, survey‑grade drone mapping, 3D printing, and Nvidia‑accelerated rendering. Use split‑screen visuals or small video loops to hint at these technologies.

Reinforce that your pricing reflects the time, expertise and advanced tools required to deliver superior results.

Market Context (Optional)

Include a tasteful chart or graphic comparing typical budgets for bespoke homes in different Puerto Rico markets to help clients understand where their project sits relative to peers.

Personalisation & Exclusive Engagement

Offer call‑to‑action buttons such as “Schedule a Private Design Session” or “Request a Custom Consultation.”

Emphasise personalised service and confidentiality; consider a section on how you tailor each project to the client’s lifestyle and aspirations.

Visual & UX Guidelines

Visual quality: invest in professional photography and, if feasible, short cinematic videos to introduce your firm—this aligns with data showing that high‑quality visuals are paramount
profiletree.com
.

Minimalist luxury aesthetic: use generous white space, a neutral palette with metallic accents, serif headlines with sans‑serif body text, and subtle animations.

Interactive charts: ensure charts are sleek and modern; avoid anything that looks like a spreadsheet.

Personalisation: tailor the page’s copy and data ranges to the specific client project.

This framework turns the raw numbers and time calculations from your internal tool into a polished, compelling narrative that high‑net‑worth clients will appreciate—showing them the value of your services while maintaining confidentiality and aligning with current luxury marketing trends

Take over

I was able to access the link successfully. The page is a comprehensive “Project Analysis Dashboard” with sections that include:

Project Overview: cards for total budget, building area, site area, and cost per square foot.

Budget Distribution: a donut chart showing new vs. remodel (currently 100 % remodel) and progress bars for shell, interior, and landscape budgets.

Cost Range Configuration: sliders to set new‑construction and remodel cost per square foot.

Construction Budget Allocation: a grid of cards for Architecture, Interior, Landscape, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, etc., showing dollar amounts and percentage shares.

Fee Analysis: a “Top‑Down” table listing scopes (e.g., Scan to BIM, Architecture, Interior) with type (in‑house/consultant), assignment toggle, market fee, and hours; a “Bottom‑Up” table summarising total hours per team member and total cost.

Project Phases & Hours Distribution: bar chart with phases (Discovery, Creative – Conceptual, etc.) and a doughnut chart showing total hours per team member.

Sanity Check & Pricing: comparison of top‑down vs. bottom‑up totals, variance, market pricing, discount slider, and final contract price with margin and hours.

Investment Summary: highlights market rate vs. in‑house price vs. final contract price; lists in‑house services included (e.g., Scan to BIM, Architecture, Interior Design) with individual costs; and shows design services distribution percentages.

Why Choose Louis Amy Engineering: bullet points on exceptional value, integrated design, full in‑house team, proven track record, plus “Accept Proposal” and “Schedule Consultation” calls to action.

Most of these elements display granular internal figures—fees, hours, percentage shares, discounts, and margins—that are valuable for internal cost analysis but would not be appropriate to show clients. For the client‑facing quotation page, the design should retain the high‑level storytelling (project overview, budget distribution by category, included services, and value proposition) while abstracting away sensitive calculations and internal hours. If you’d like, I can refine the earlier proposal for the client‑facing page using this detailed knowledge of your dashboard.
