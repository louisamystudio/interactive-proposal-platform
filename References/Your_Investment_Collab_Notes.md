# YOUR INVESTMENT — Working Draft

This draft transcribes and organizes the three options from your slides so we can mark up changes together.

---

## 01 · Option A — Fully Integrated Vision
**Fixed investment:** $187,099

**What’s included**
- **Single, integrated team:** Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape **+** full Structural/Civil/Plumbing engineering coordination—one accountable studio.
- **Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM):** Building **+** site; BIM federation with clash‑resolved documentation to reduce surprises.
- **Core visualization:** Interior **and** Exterior VR for confident decisions and fewer late changes.

**Ideal for:** *Maximum cohesion, speed of decisions, and single‑point accountability.*

**Breakdown (as shown)**
- Scan‑to‑BIM ~4% ≈ $7,484
- Building Shell ~60% ≈ $112,259
- Interior ~24% ≈ $44,904
- Landscape ~12% ≈ $22,452

## 02 · Option B — Collaborative Partnership
*(Louis Amy — architecture‑led + your interior designer consultant, Louis Bernard)*

**Fixed investment:** $126,636

**What’s included**
- **Authored by Louis Amy:** Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing permit deliverables.
- **Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM):** Landscape Architecture; Reality Capture baseline.
- **Core visualization:** Exterior VR for confident decisions and fewer late changes. **3D Interior Renderings and VR are out of scope.**
- **Interior Design:** Coordination to harmonize your interior designer’s work.
- **(Slide also repeats)** *“Core visualization: Interior and Exterior VR for confident decisions and fewer late changes.”* → **conflicts** with the “interior out of scope” line above.

**Ideal when:** *You want to keep a trusted interior designer while preserving architectural coherence and schedule certainty.*

**Breakdown (as shown)**
- Scan‑to‑BIM ~5% ≈ $6,332
- Building Shell ~65% ≈ $82,314
- Landscape ~12% ≈ $15,196
- Coordination Fee **~15%** ≈ **$22,794**  ← **Mismatch:** $22,794 is ~18% of $126,636; 15% would be ≈ $18,995.

> **Flag to resolve for Option B**
> - Pick one: either *Exterior‑only VR* or *Interior & Exterior VR*.  
> - Confirm Coordination Fee percent/amount (15% ≈ $18,995 **or** 18% ≈ $22,794).  
> - If fee is 15%, total labeled amounts add to $122,837, leaving ≈ $3,799 (3%) unallocated.

## 03 · Option C — Architectural Foundation (Shell and Outdoor Baseline)
*(Louis Amy — architecture‑led + your interior designer consultant, Louis Bernard)*

**Fixed investment:** $87,898

**What’s included**
- **Authored by Louis Amy:** Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing permit deliverables.
- **Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM):** Landscape Architecture; Reality Capture baseline.
- **Core visualization:** Exterior VR for confident decisions and fewer late changes. **3D Interior Renderings and VR are out of scope.**
- **Interior Design:** Coordination to harmonize your interior designer’s work.
- **Exclusions:** Interior & Landscape authored by others; interfaces documented.

**Ideal when:** *You want to keep a trusted interior designer while preserving architectural coherence and schedule certainty.*

**Breakdown (as shown)**
- Scan‑to‑BIM ~6% ≈ $5,274
- Building Shell ~94% ≈ $82,624 *(no Interiors or Landscape authoring in this tier).*

---

## Quick Comparison (headlines)
- **Total investment:** A = $187,099 · B = $126,636 · C = $87,898
- **VR scope:** A = Interior & Exterior; B = *Exterior only (as first line)*; C = Exterior only.
- **Interiors authorship:** A = Louis Amy; B = Your interior designer (LA coordinates); C = Others (LA coordinates only).
- **Landscape authorship:** A = included; B = included; C = baseline / authored by others (interfaces documented).

## Open Questions / Edits to Confirm
1. **Option B – Coordination Fee math:** 15% of $126,636 is **$18,995**, not $22,794. $22,794 ≈ **18%**. Which is correct?
2. **Option B – Visualization line duplicated/contradictory:** Keep *Exterior‑only VR* and remove the second line, or upgrade to *Interior + Exterior VR*?
3. **Option C – Wording check:** “Landscape Architecture; Reality Capture baseline” vs “Exclusions: Landscape authored by others”. Keep as *baseline only; authored by others in this tier*?

### Scratchpad (for notes during our collaboration)
- [ ] Decide on Option B Coordination Fee percentage and update dollars.
- [ ] Pick final wording for VR scope in Options B & C.
- [ ] Any additional inclusions/exclusions to list?
