De Jesús Project: Tailored Design Options & Value-Based Pricing
(Saved responses are view only)
The client, Dr. Luis De Jesús, has explicitly requested the full proposal for his review and decision, indicating a serious interest in proceeding [Query]. However, he has also raised a key constraint: the potential use of his own interior designer, Louis Bernard, with whom he has a long-standing relationship of approximately 25 years [Query]. This suggests he might be looking to lower the price, which could impact the architectural design quality if not properly managed [Query]. The prompt follow-up requested by the client underscores the need for a swift and well-articulated response [Query].
Louis Amy Engineering's existing proposal already highlights a comprehensive suite of in-house services, including Architecture, Structural Engineering, Civil/Site Engineering, Plumbing Engineering, Scan to BIM (Building and Site), Interior Design, and Landscape Architecture. The proposal emphasizes the benefits of a "Full In-House Team" and an "Integrated Design Approach" for "Seamless coordination between all disciplines for optimal results", offering "Exceptional Value" at $45,914.50 below market rates. The estimated total project budget for the 6,000 sq ft residential remodel is $5,100,000.00, with a significant 22% allocated to the Interior Budget ($1,122,000) and $33,607.09 for in-house Interior Design services in the overall design fees.
To address Dr. De Jesús's concerns and maintain a premium position while offering flexibility, the proposed modular scope options—Full Bespoke (A), Architecture-Led + Client’s Designer (B), and Core Architecture Only (C)—align well with Chris Do's principles of value-based pricing and conversational selling.
Pricing Strategy — Options Louis Amy Engineering Intends to Present
1. Option A — Full Bespoke (Anchor)
• Scope: This option encompasses Architecture + Interiors + Landscape + Engineering Coordination + Reality Capture + Visualization [Proposed Options]. It leverages Louis Amy Engineering's "Full In-House Team" and "Integrated Design Approach", providing direct access to architects, engineers, and designers under one roof for "Seamless coordination between all disciplines for optimal results". The proposal already details this comprehensive offering, including Scan to BIM (Building and Site), which provides "precision beyond the naked eye with 3D laser scanning" and "millimeter-level accuracy" for accurate documentation and integration.
• Narrative: The narrative emphasizes "One accountable team, seamless design language, clash-resolved docs, fewer surprises" [Proposed Options]. This directly speaks to Louis Amy's stated commitment to "Risk Reduction" through "Precision technologies [that] minimize errors and unforeseen challenges, protecting your investment" and delivering "Exceptional Outcomes". This holistic approach is designed to "create spaces that inspire and transform".
• Price: By anchoring at or near the Market Rate card ($187,099.00), this option establishes a premium position [172, Proposed Options]. Chris Do emphasizes that commanding a premium is possible when a company is clear on its values and delivers consistent quality, making it harder for clients to compare solely on price. The justification would focus on the integrated value of having one cohesive team for a "smooth and efficient construction journey", ensuring "precision and peace of mind", rather than simply tallying hours. This approach helps clients understand they are paying for a desired outcome—a flawlessly executed, integrated design—not just the effort.
2. Option B — Architecture-Led + Interiors by Client’s Designer
• Scope: This option proposes Architecture lead; Interiors by client’s designer; our deliverables include Interfaces & Coordination (opening sizes, casework envelopes, services rough-ins, finish schedules as “by others”), BIM federation, clash resolution, and oversight to maintain architectural intent [Proposed Options]. This directly addresses Dr. De Jesús's desire to use Louis Bernard while still ensuring the architectural design quality [Query]. Louis Amy's advanced technologies, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), are explicitly listed as providing "Precision and Clarity" and "Real-Time Collaboration and Coordination", which are critical for effective coordination with an external designer.
• Narrative & Value: This option reframes the conversation from a price reduction to a defined scope change, aligning with Chris Do's advice to tie pricing to value rather than simply discounting. The value here is risk mitigation and design integrity. Louis Amy would act as the central coordinator, ensuring seamless integration of the client's interior design choices with the overall architectural and engineering plans. This would prevent potential conflicts, costly redesigns, and ensure the project's coherence. The proposal already outlines Supplemental Services, which include "15% Coordination Fee" for "orchestration and integration of Supplemental Services provided by sub-consultants," reflecting the value of Louis Amy's management efforts. This existing framework can be applied to coordinating with Louis Bernard.
• Add-alternates: Optional visualization packs and coordination intensity tiers [Proposed Options] provide further flexibility. This allows Dr. De Jesús to choose additional services, like "Stunning, Photorealistic Detail" and "Immersive, Real-Time Visualizations", that enhance understanding without committing to full interior design authoring, further tailoring the solution to his needs and budget.
• Price: Positioned "Slightly below the Full Bespoke anchor", this option defends the price through "scope line not discounting" [Proposed Options]. This maintains Louis Amy's premium brand perception while acknowledging the reduced scope of authoring interiors. By highlighting the value of expert coordination and risk reduction, Louis Amy avoids being an "order taker" and instead acts as a strategic advisor.
3. Option C — Core Architecture Only (Lowest Scope)
• Scope: This lean option covers Planning approvals, core documents, baseline coordination; explicit exclusions on interiors authoring and FF&E [Proposed Options]. This clearly delineates Louis Amy's core architectural responsibilities from interior design, which is not authored or included.
• Risk Controls: Crucially, this option includes "Cap on redesign cycles; paid add-services for program changes" [Proposed Options]. This directly addresses Chris Do's warnings about scope creep, which he attributes to poorly brokered deals and undercharging. By setting clear boundaries and charging for additional complexity, Louis Amy protects its profitability and project quality.
• Price: This option is the "Lowest anchor" and serves to "frame value of B and A (contrast)" [Proposed Options]. By presenting a significantly lower price for minimal services, it makes the value proposition of the more comprehensive options (A and B) much clearer and more attractive. This helps the client understand the "cost of inaction" or the risks associated with inadequate coordination and design integration.
Important Safeguards (All Tiers)
• Interfaces Matrix & Coordination Gateways: The development of a "Clear responsibilities & hand-offs with client’s interior designer" and "BIM submissions and review windows; change management policy" [Proposed Options] is paramount. This establishes a structured approach to collaboration, ensuring clear communication and accountability, which are critical for seamless project execution and client satisfaction. These processes help manage potential "Change Order Requests" and ensure "quality and precision" throughout the build.
• Fee-scope coupling: "Any added complexity (wellness spaces, custom millwork, specialty lighting) requires fee uplift or add-service" [Proposed Options]. This reinforces Louis Amy's value-based pricing model, ensuring that increased complexity or specialized design elements, which often have a higher perceived value to the client, are reflected in the compensation. This prevents undercharging for valuable, intricate work.
Overall Negotiation Approach (Drawing on Chris Do's Principles)
When engaging Dr. De Jesús, the negotiation should be framed as a "conversational sale" aimed at helping the client achieve their desired future state.
1. Listen and Ask Questions: Instead of immediately presenting options, begin by asking "big, beautiful, wonderful questions" to understand Dr. De Jesús's core motivations. Is his inquiry about Louis Bernard driven purely by cost concerns, by a deep trust in Bernard's aesthetic vision, or a desire for control? Questions like, "What aspects of your relationship with Louis Bernard are most important to you for this project?" or "What are your primary goals for the interior design, and how do you envision Louis Bernard helping achieve those?" can uncover deeper insights.
2. Empathize and Validate: Acknowledge and respect his long-standing relationship with Louis Bernard [Query]. This builds trust and rapport, essential for "selling without being salesy".
3. Present Value-Based Options: Clearly articulate the benefits and outcomes of each option, especially how they address potential pain points or risks. For Option A, emphasize the peace of mind from "one accountable team" [Proposed Options, 174, 278]. For Option B, highlight how Louis Amy's coordination services proactively mitigate risks of aesthetic clashes or technical incompatibilities, protecting his investment and maintaining architectural integrity [Proposed Options, 250, 277].
4. Avoid Price-First Discussion: Frame the discussion around value first, then price. Chris Do advises against talking about price until the client's problem, desired outcome, and the value of solving that problem are clearly established. The $45,914.50 savings already offered can be a starting point to illustrate Louis Amy's commitment to value.
5. Be Confident in Your Premium: Louis Amy's established expertise, integrated approach, and advanced technology (like BIM and 3D laser scanning) justify a premium position. Confidence in discussing price reflects strong business acumen.
6. Offer Choices, Not Convince: The goal is to provide clarity so Dr. De Jesús can make an informed decision aligned with his goals, rather than convincing him.
7. Prompt and Professional Follow-up: Given the client's request for prompt follow-up, a well-structured and timely response demonstrating a clear understanding of his needs and offering tailored solutions will be crucial [Query].
