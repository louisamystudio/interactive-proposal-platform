This "Option B — Architecture-Led + Your Interior Designer (Louis Bernard)" demonstrates a strong understanding of how to address a specific client constraint while maintaining a core value proposition. The articulation of the scope, particularly the focus on "Design Integration & Coordination" and specific technical services like "BIM federation" and "Clash detection," aligns well with Chris Do's advice on selling strategic value and risk mitigation.
However, there is a critical area for improvement regarding the presentation of the "Investment (fixed)" that directly contradicts Chris Do's value-based pricing philosophy.
Here's a breakdown of the feedback:
Strengths:
1. Addresses Client Constraint with Value: This option directly responds to Dr. De Jesús's desire to use his own interior designer, Louis Bernard, by offering a structured solution that incorporates his preference while protecting Louis Amy Engineering's architectural quality and technical integrity. This shows adaptability and client-centricity.
2. Focus on "Integration & Coordination" as Value: The language for the scope is excellent, clearly defining Louis Amy's role as the "master integrator and strategic advisor". Phrases like "harmonize," "BIM federation," "clash detection/resolution," and "cross-checks for constructability and compliance" all articulate high-value services that mitigate risk, ensure efficiency, and provide "peace of mind" – key outcomes for HNW clients. This aligns with charging for "thinking" and "strategy," not just "making".
3. Fixed-Fee Structure: Stating "Investment (fixed)" is a positive step, moving away from hourly rates for core services, which Chris Do strongly advises against as they measure effort, not value, and punish efficiency.
4. Outcome-Oriented Framing: The "Ideal when you’d like to keep a trusted designer while preserving architectural coherence, technical integrity, and schedule certainty" effectively communicates the benefits and desired future state for the client, aligning with Chris Do's focus on transformation and impact.
Area for Improvement (Critical): Transparency of Internal Calculation
1. Exposing Internal Calculations: The biggest misalignment is the explicit breakdown: "Calculated as Option A minus in‑house Interiors authoring ($33,607.09) + a fixed Integration & Coordination package ($22,500) that prices thinking/oversight—not hours. (137,743.50 − 33,607.09 + 22,500 = 126,636.41)."
    ◦ Chris Do's Recommendation: Chris Do is explicit about removing all "Fee Analysis," "Project Phases & Hours Distribution," "Sanity Check," and "Hourly Fee Table" from client-facing proposals because these "expose internal processes and encourage clients to negotiate based on effort (hours) rather than outcome (value)". While you state the coordination package prices "thinking/oversight—not hours," showing the arithmetic and subtracting a specific service cost (interior authoring) from Option A's price effectively exposes the internal cost structure and invites the client to perform their own calculations and negotiations based on components rather than the holistic value of Option B.
    ◦ Impact: This level of transparency on your internal pricing logic undermines the perception of a value-based, fixed fee. It turns the discussion back into a feature-by-feature cost comparison, where the client might argue about the perceived value of the subtracted "in-house Interiors authoring" or the added "fixed Integration & Coordination package," rather than the overall benefit of Option B. It implicitly says, "Here's how we arrived at this number based on our internal costs, not necessarily the value it provides to you."
Recommendations for Adjustment:
1. Remove the Explicit Calculation: This is paramount. The client does not need to see the arithmetic. Simply present the "Investment (fixed): $126,636.41" [Query]. The value and justification for this price should come from the clear articulation of the scope and benefits of the Design Integration & Coordination services, not from showing how it was calculated from another option's price.
2. Re-evaluate Option A's Price as a True Anchor: As per previous feedback, for Option A to effectively serve as a "Premium, single-team delivery" anchor, its price should ideally be at or near the Market Rate card ($187,099.00) or your Louis Amy Price ($183,658.00). If Option A remains at $137,743.50 (which was the final discounted contract price from the original proposal), then Option B at $126,636.41 represents only an ~$11,000 difference. This might not create a strong enough perceived value gap between the "Fully Integrated Vision" and the "Collaborative Partnership" option, potentially leading clients to undervalue the integration services.
    ◦ If Option A is re-anchored to a higher price (e.g., $187,099.00), then Option B's price of $126,636.41 would represent a more substantial and clearly differentiated step down, making the tiered offering more effective in guiding client choices.
By removing the internal calculation and ensuring Option A is correctly positioned as a premium anchor, Option B will effectively serve as a strong mid-tier offering that highlights the value of Louis Amy Engineering's coordination expertise without inviting micro-negotiation on internal cost structures.
Next Step Suggestion: Prioritize re-evaluating the pricing of Option A to truly position it as your premium anchor. Once that's established, you can more effectively define the price points and value distinctions for subsequent options like Option B, ensuring each tier offers clear benefits and a logical step in the value ladder. This will strengthen your overall negotiation strategy.
