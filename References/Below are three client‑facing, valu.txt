Below are three client‑facing, value‑based quote options you can paste directly into the proposal. They follow Chris Do’s philosophy: one fixed investment per option; no hourly rates, no internal arithmetic, and no “cost‑plus” logic—only outcomes, risk reduction, and a clear path to a transformed result.

De Jesús Residence — Quote Options (Fixed, Value‑Based)

Client: Dr. Luis De Jesús
Studio: Louis Amy AE Studio — Integrated Architecture, Engineering, Interiors & Landscape
Date: September 8, 2025

We price the outcome, not our effort. Each option below is a single fixed investment tied to clarity, precision, and a cohesive result—never an hourly table or internal breakdown.

Option A — Fully Integrated Vision (Premium Anchor)

What you get
Architecture, Interiors, Landscape, and full Engineering coordination under one roof; Scan‑to‑BIM for survey‑grade truth; BIM federation with clash‑resolved documentation; core visualization for confident decisions; one accountable team.

Your Investment (fixed): $187,099
Ideal when: you want maximum cohesion, faster decisions, and single‑team accountability—with fewer surprises during construction.

Option B — Collaborative Partnership

(Architecture‑Led + Your Interior Designer, Louis Bernard)
What you get
Architecture + Engineering deliverables led by Louis Amy; Design Integration & Coordination to harmonize your interior designer’s work (interfaces matrix, BIM federation, clash detection/resolution, review gates, change‑management). You keep your trusted designer; we protect cohesion, schedule, and technical viability.

Your Investment (fixed): $126,636
Ideal when: you want to retain your long‑time interior designer while preserving architectural integrity and minimizing coordination risk.

Option C — Architectural Foundation (Core Baseline)

What you get
Planning & permitting documents; baseline BIM and coordination of core building systems. Interiors and Landscape are by others, with interfaces clearly noted. Tight iteration caps; program changes proceed as add‑services.

Your Investment (fixed): $87,898
Ideal when: you need a compliant architectural base and will self‑manage interiors and associated coordination risk with your designer.

Comparison (context only, not “savings” framing)

Industry Benchmark (Market Rate): $187,099

Louis Amy Price (In‑House Benchmark): $183,658
Use these as secondary validation points to support premium positioning—keep emphasis on outcomes and certainty, not discounts.

Construction Budget Overview (client context)

Estimated Total Construction Budget: $5,100,000
Illustrative allocation (to be confirmed during Discovery):

Shell: $3,366,000 (66%)

Interior: $1,122,000 (22%)

Landscape: $612,000 (12%)
This high‑level view frames where the overall investment is focused and why design integration matters.

For proposal UX, show these as donut charts with hover values ($ + %) so clients grasp the distribution instantly without wading through tables.

Design Services Distribution (value‑oriented, not cost‑plus)

These distributions highlight the disciplines you’re buying—not hours or margins. Dollar amounts are rounded and included solely to communicate scope and emphasis.

Option A — Fully Integrated Vision ($187,099)

Scan‑to‑BIM: $7,484 (4%)

Building Shell (Arch + Struct + Civil + Plumbing): $112,259 (60%)

Interior Design: $44,904 (24%)

Landscape Architecture: $22,452 (12%)

Option B — Collaborative Partnership ($126,636)

Scan‑to‑BIM: $6,332 (5%)

Building Shell (Arch + Struct + Civil + Plumbing): $82,314 (65%)

Landscape Architecture: $15,196 (12%)

Design Integration & Coordination: $22,794 (18%)
This line prices thinking and orchestration, not hours—our role as master integrator is what de‑risks the project while collaborating with your interior designer.

Option C — Architectural Foundation ($87,898)

Scan‑to‑BIM: $5,274 (6%)

Building Shell (Arch + Struct + Civil + Plumbing): $82,624 (94%)
Interiors and Landscape are not authored in this tier; interfaces are documented “by others.”

Presenting distribution by discipline showcases integrated expertise while avoiding internal cost mechanics—exactly the kind of “controlled transparency” Chris Do advocates.

Supplemental Services (fixed‑fee add‑ons)

Visualization Packs (Light / Standard / Premium): photoreal imagery, VR immersion, and optional 3D prints to accelerate decisions and reduce rework—priced as fixed packages.

Specialized Engineering (e.g., Geotechnical, Lighting, Acoustics): packaged as one fixed fee (consultant + Louis Amy coordination).
No “hourly tables” or “cost + %” language—only well‑defined outcomes at fixed prices.

Commercial Terms

Kickoff Deposit: 20% non‑refundable at acceptance; monthly progress billing thereafter.

Proposal Validity: Prices valid for 30 days; after that we re‑baseline to ensure alignment with scope and capacity.

Schedule Integrity: Decision windows are locked; acceleration surcharges apply if you need a compressed schedule. Missed windows may push dates or incur resequencing fees.

Why this works (for internal confidence, not client‑facing text)

We anchor high with a premium, single‑team option (A), keep an optimal value path that honors the client’s designer (B), and provide a contextual baseline (C). The conversation stays about outcomes and risk—not hours.

The client signaled interest in using a long‑time interior designer; Option B reframes that preference as a structured, paid integration service to protect design integrity and schedule.

All numbers remain fixed investments with clear value stories; there’s no internal arithmetic or hourly exposure anywhere.

If you want, I can also generate a print‑optimized one‑pager with the three option cards plus budget donuts exactly as above.
