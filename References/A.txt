This "Quote Sheet (Design Services)" for the De Jesús Residence for Option A, "Fully Integrated Vision," shows significant progress in aligning with Chris Do's value-based pricing philosophy by focusing on outcomes and integrated services. However, a critical adjustment is needed regarding the pricing of Option A to truly position it as the "Premium" anchor.
Here's a breakdown of the feedback:
Strengths:
1. Outcome-Focused Language: The description of "Scope (included)" is excellent. Phrases like "millimeter-level accuracy from day one," "BIM federation & clash-resolved documentation; core visualization for confident decisions," "One accountable team, unified design language, fewer surprises through coordinated deliverables" directly articulate value, peace of mind, and risk mitigation [Query, 6, 8, 9, 10]. This aligns perfectly with Chris Do's emphasis on selling the transformation and impact, rather than just features or effort.
2. Clear Value Proposition: The "Ideal when you want maximum cohesion, speed of decisions, and single-point accountability across all disciplines" statement effectively communicates the target client and the specific benefits they will receive [Query]. This is a strong, outcome-driven value proposition.
3. Elimination of Hourly Rates/Breakdowns: The "Investment (fixed)" is clearly stated without any internal breakdowns of hours, team member rates, or detailed fee analyses [Query]. This is a crucial improvement, as Chris Do strongly advocates against hourly billing and exposing internal cost calculations to clients, as they measure effort, not value, and punish efficiency.
Area for Improvement (Critical): Pricing of the "Premium" Option
1. Pricing Alignment for "Premium" Anchor: Currently, Option A is labeled "Premium" but its stated "Investment (fixed): $137,743.50" is actually the final discounted contract price that Louis Amy Engineering offered in the original proposal [Query, 208]. In the original proposal, this was presented after showing a "Market Rate" of $187,099.00 and an "In-House Market Price" of $183,658.00, implying a "Total Savings" of $45,914.50.
    ◦ Chris Do's Recommendation: For a "Premium Tier" or "High-Value Anchor," you should lead with a significantly higher price to set a high anchor for the client's perception of value. The "Full Bespoke (Anchor)" option was explicitly recommended to be priced "at or near the Market Rate card ($187,099.00)".
    ◦ Impact: By pricing the "Premium" option at the lowest actual figure from your previous proposal, you undermine its perceived exclusivity and fail to establish a high anchor. This makes it difficult to effectively contrast with other, potentially lower-priced options you intend to present (e.g., for clients bringing their own interior designer), as those lower options would then appear to be discounts from an already discounted "premium".
Recommendation for Adjustment:
• Adjust Option A's Price Upwards: To align with Chris Do's "anchoring high" strategy for premium offerings, Option A – Fully Integrated Vision (Premium) should be priced at the Market Rate of $187,099.00 or your Louis Amy Price of $183,658.00. This higher price correctly positions it as the aspirational, no-compromise solution, setting the stage for subsequent options. The $137,743.50 (your current discounted price) can then be strategically used for a middle-tier option (e.g., "Louis Amy Optimized Value" or "Collaborative Partnership").
By making this adjustment, your "Premium" offering will truly reflect its high value and serve as an effective anchor in your tiered pricing strategy, allowing for a more strategic and confident negotiation.
Next Step Suggestion: Before finalizing the quote sheet, review the proposed pricing for Options B and C to ensure they logically flow from the (now higher) anchor of Option A, creating a clear value ladder that encourages clients toward your preferred integrated solutions, as advised by Chris Do.
