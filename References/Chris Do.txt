'm going to share with you 10 things that I quit to go from broke to millionaire these are the exact same things that I quit to build two eight figure businesses so without further Ado let's get into my 10 things to quit to go from broke to millionaire starting with number one quit spending time to save money people underestimate the value of their time they think it's an infinite renewable resource it's not it's the most precious thing that you have and how you leverage your time is really important what successful entrepreneurs learn is that they trade their money for their time the example is this you're going to drive across town wait in line for 30 minutes so you can save some money on toilet paper is that really a good use of your time and how much money are you really saving now that seems pretty obvious to most of us that we wouldn't do that but think in your own business how many times that you've sat there and interviewed the 50th person for a $10 job it doesn't make sense take a shot take a risk but whatever you do prioritize your time legendary business consultant Peter duer wrote in the effective executive the number one most important thing that you need to do is to protect your time to gather and consolidate the largest amount of discretionary time in in corporate culture what is the biggest time suck of them all meetings we have meetings about meetings to talk about more meetings that we're about to have nothing is getting done if you add up the value of everybody in that room you start to realize how they're using that time so poorly which leads us to number two quit spending your time with energy vampires you know who they are as soon as you're around them they suck all of your energy they're usually pessimist they're negative Neds and Jim Ron wrote about this you are the average of The Five People You spend the most time with so when you're spending time with people who don't value their time who have bad habits who are spending money frivolously some of that actually in influences you to do the same thing stop spending your time with them you know the expression misery loves company so when misery sends you the invitation to the pity party send that invitation back don't be a part of this millionaire the people who are very successful live in the world of possibility they say I can versus I can't this might work versus why would this work and number three quit shiny object syndrome you know how like dogs are they're doing something they're super focused and they see a squirrel running by and they're like who squirrel squirrel they're easily distracted they're never getting anything done because they're constantly switching their task or their focus or their goal or their mission it's constant second guessing and they get stuck in this Loop and then you look back one year 5 years 10 years and they have not done anything with their life they've not moved forward cuz they've moved laterally number four quit taking advice from the wrong people it's not so easy to determine the wrong people unless you use some kind of criteria for who you're going to listen to let me give you the easiest one somebody on social media says don't do this don't do that or this is dumb or that's good and you're like yeah I should do that well who are these people what have they done general rule of thumb not always true but take advice from people who are where you want to be who've done what it is that you want to do number five is a big one quit playing it safe you need to take some risk again let's quote Peter Ducker here in business all profit comes from risk you don't have big gains from not taking big risks the world rewards you for taking big risk the first person to do something is taking all the risk and they pave the way for every wants to follow and so in business it's best to be first you got to learn to take some big risk if you want the big reward here's the analogue for you if you want to play it safe you're going to get safe return so if you put your money into a mutual fund a b you're going to get a couple of percentage points put it in a bank it's safe it's not going to go anywhere but that's the sad part it's not going to go anywhere now conversely in tech stocks or even cryptocurrencies you can risk a lot and get a lot and that's what the millionaires do they're willing to make nine Bad bets to have one bet pay off 1,000 times their investment so you can understand that how that works in the real world apply that to your own thinking number six quit blaming others I'm a big believer in radical accountability and to take responsibility for everything that happens to you for you with you it's the only way you grow it's the only way you learn we can get stuck in saying well this didn't happen because someone didn't do this for me or you know I was born into this life therefore I can't do this thing you're resigning yourself to be a fatalist like my fate has already been sealed because other people have set things in motion that have no control over now let's just have a philosophical debate right now let's just say your life is predetermined or set and if you resign to saying this is how it's going to be well pretty much that's how it's going to be but let's say there's a 1% chance that you're wrong but you take responsibility and you actually do something about it I'd rather live in a world where I believe I have influence over my life and outcomes that I have then to accept that nothing can be changed even if there's only 1% chance that that's true you know how often when something works out everybody's got their hand I'm like well it worked because I said this or I gave him that idea or I executed this or I showed up the door and knocked on the door there's this expression and maybe it's a little off-color expression but success has many fathers but failure has one mother and it's a kind of a truism like no one wants to step up to own the failure I personally believe when I understand the failure I'm I have a better blueprint for Success so I'll be the one who's like it's my fault even when it's not my fault because at the end of the day everything's going to be my fault anyways and I want to learn versus pushing on that responsibility somebody else number seven quit acting on impulse you got to think longterm you got to play the long game think in decades and not in days this is all about delayed gratification so in my life my dad told me this thing it's it's a piece of advice that's stuck with me all these years he goes in life you have a short time in which you can make it rather than having fun and working a little bit having fun and working a little bit which will prolong the amount of time in which it takes for you to achieve the success make all the sacrifices work really really hard achieve the level of success and then you can decide there from the platform or the place that you're in what you want to do with the rest of your life you can Coast if you want and you can live on your success or you can continue to build that so it compounds even more that's up to you number eight this one's going to be hard for you here quit saying yes to everything because every time you say yes to something you're saying no to something else this is a problem I've always had because as a middle child and as a people pleaser I always said yes because I don't want other people to feel uncomfortable and then I found at the end of the day I didn't get my work done I didn't honor my relationships and then I just created more stress for myself this is really really important important Derek sver writes about this in his book hell yeah or hell no basically if it doesn't fill you with joy if this is not something you're really looking forward to you need to honor yourself honor your time and your relationships and say you know what this isn't what I want to do give yourself permission to say no more often saying no more often gives power to your yes because if everything's a yes your yeses have little meaning and now on to number nine my favorite quit looking for shortcuts you see everybody trying to promise you the easy way to do something that requires no effort no money no time why would that even work my mom taught me this many years ago if it's too good to be true it's probably not true life is difficult and it rewards people for doing the difficult work and this is really important for you understand I just had a wonderful conversation recently with Mark Manson the author of subtle art of not giving a f and he starts his book with something like this I'm paraphrasing here that the avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering itself it's kind of very Buddhist idea that life is suffering and we're trying to avoid suffering so we don't like stress we don't want challenges we don't want to do difficult things so when challenging things come difficult things come we don't know how to respond I built my life up to embrace the difficult things to do the things that few people are willing to do to do it with the conviction and the perseverance that I need to do it with and I know at the end of that hard work rainbow is a pot of gold if everyone could be an influencer create content that connects with people if everyone could be a great teacher I'd have nothing to do so I enjoy doing the hard work so I can get into this place where not a lot of people are able to achieve because they quit and because it's scarce because not a lot of people want to do it not a lot of people see it through it's valuable scarce things are valuable do the difficult work when you take shortcuts what you're trying to do is to get to result with the acquiring the skills this is a very important thing rather than looking at Life as a pursuit of money or things look at Life as a Pursuit or acquisition of skills because the skills compound in you and no one can take them away from you the more valuable skills you acquire the more valuable you become the more value you will create number 10 quit being an information hoarder so many of us get stuck in a state where we want to learn and it creates safety for us like we're forever students we stay in school we get a master's degree we get a PhD because we're trying to delay the inevitable which is to test our skills in the real world in the marketplace itself so what I want you to do is to love learning but to love applying what you learn more than what you do so what I'm saying is I want you to love learning but I want you to love applying more than just learning for learning's sake that's some form of mental masturbation I believe so here's the hack right when you're reading something ask yourself a few questions before you even pick up the book ask yourself why am I reading this book what is it I want to get from this book and how will I apply my life that way as you're reading through the book you're searching for pieces of information that you can e easily and immediately Implement you made it all the way through 10 well I have a bonus for you as a reward for your persistence to make it through this video it's bonus number 11 quit comparing yourself to others uh there's a quote comparison is the thief of Joy so much of our happiness so much of our well-being and our self-worth is defined by where we sit relative to others we're constantly comparing competing against what others are accomplishing according to our own set of rules the best kind of competition is the one where you compete against yourself where you say in the last year this is what I've been able to do this is how my mind has expanded these are the risk I've taken on these are the ventures I've taken on these are the relationships that I built this is how much I've grown in the last year the only comparison that's worthwhile is the comparison with your old self putting these rules into practice will help you become successful in any industry and if you want to learn how to do that watch this video the secret to being successful in any industry it's a short f 5 minute video


so when people say we'll make people believe this that our brand you can't you can show up you can present yourself you can be consistent you can behave and speak a certain way but then it's up to the other person decide brand is a person's gut feeling it's not what you say it is it's what they say it is we know what branding is it's impression management how we influence people's perceptions of us we want to be true not inauthentic so then now what is positioning without further Ado we have an amazing keynote speaker today let's give an incredible
welcome to Mr Chris doe all right all right thank you very much I'm going to just start with a really brief story and that when I was in high school I wasn't sure a career in design was the way to go because the only examples of creative people that I saw that were working were like drawing your portrait at the Fisherman's Warf or somebody who would airbrush your name I mean they're artists and they're beautiful but I was like I don't want to live that
that life that looks like a really rough life so as as a junior in high school I took an aptitude test I went to the career counselor I went through the whole thing do you like to talk to people no do you like facts yes you know linear binary great great great great so it told me that I was supposed to be of all things an accountant so you know maybe this is a long homecoming trip for me so I say that so we may have more in common than you think so for for most of my career I worked in commercials and music video and that's what I did
did and I found out that within the creative Community they needed a lot of help with business skills and so that's what I was doing I was teaching creatives business skills pricing negotiation sales those kinds of things and then I realized just very recently in the last year there's this whole other group of people I I'll refer to them as left reiners I know that's a kind of a small container to put people into but what they wanted to do was to be creative so I was sitting here facing creatives trying to teach them business skills and then on this other side they
there were business people who wanted to learn creative skills and I don't think we're all that different I think there's this really neat intersection between the two creatives who want to be entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs who want to be creative so I'm hoping that's the reason why Hector has me here today so without further Ado I know I have not a lot of time so I'm going to push through this keynote presentation I put together okay so we're going to get into branding fundamentals now one of the interesting things is I was recently speaking at an event where there were a bunch of Realtors and the one realtor came up to me and said
Chris I'm so glad you're talking about branding because our people don't understand branding I said that's okay because branding people don't understand branding So today we're going to try to come together right so don't feel like you're left out I'm going to just try to give you the primer to introduce you to some Concepts that you can use today but obviously there's a lot more that you're going to need to learn so this is meant to be a bit interactive and I love that people are already yelling at me I love it I don't want to stand up here and just talk to myself the whole time so I
I just want you to think about like two or three words that come to your mind just first process like complete the sentence for me a brand is and just think about it a brand is what story story identity Vision Vision who we are who we are exting exciting what recogniz recognizable image image okay we got a lot of this is great so you can see that no one gave us the same answer and that's probably the problem there's lots of definitions for a brand and I'm going to go to the guy who wrote the book on
brand and his name is Marty newm so he says a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or organization it's a gut feeling okay so it's not it's not what you say it is it's what they say it is so we all can say we're our brand is about care empathy going the extra mile but if your culture and your company do not behave that way what is your brand it's what they say it is so if you're Kurt if you're always looking at the bottom line and you nickel and dime your clients that that's your brand
brand it's what people say about you make sense so whereas products are made in factories brands are made in the hearts and minds of people the people that you serve at every touch point in which they come in contact with every touch point a lot of people mistakenly think that a brand is the visual aspect the the identity of the logo is just a container for meaning Nike has the Nike swos has no meaning if the company does not produce products that we love and tell a story that we want to repeat and tell others does that make sense
so what happens is when you get into a room full of designers like well the logo is the brand kind of but not really it's a container for meaning there are beautiful containers and they're ugly containers and I'm a design snob I'll admit it to you there are companies that I love whose logo is terrible therefore I do not buy their products I'm like that I know it's terrible it's a disease okay so now we understand yeah so then therefore branding is what what is branding so if a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service organiz
ation what is branding okay connecting with them now the room got real quiet for some reason what's that making what they say okay how you present your brand okay a lot of good answers here Behavior okay all right this is very good right I like the looks in your faces you're still pretty active right now we'll see how we're doing by the end of this
all right so if it's a gut feeling we when we talk about feelings can we control people's feelings no but we can influence them most definitely okay we can influence but we can't control so when people say we'll make people believe this out our brand you can't you can show up you can present yourself you can be consistent you can behave and speak a certain way but then it's up to the other person to decide so Marty goes on to say if enough people have a similar gut feeling about you than you have a brand inevitably with accountants you're going to say well how many is
enough people is it 36.7% or what is it I don't know he just said enough people we'll just leave it at that okay all right so there was a recent article in the Harvard Business review about building your personal brand and I just wanted to pull a little bit don't bother reading the issue it's not very good sorry hbr okay so we know this in every interaction people are forming opinions about all of you all the time so okay we that makes sense right and then Jeff bzo says well brand is what people
say about you when you're not in the room that makes sense too okay so when you leave that's when people's real feelings come out and so my friend Christine lucer Dr Christine lucer said that well then branding is impression management we can understand that right because you create an impression an imprint on each and every single person from your children to your co-worker to your boss your employees to everyone in the room you create an impression so you want to manage that impression if you can so the way that you dress the way you speak
the way you carry yourself the content of what you say the consistency in which you show up the energy you put out there is part of the impression management the easiest way to understand this is when you show up for a job interview you remember back like when you still have pimples on your face and you showed up for a job interview you dressed a certain way because you dress for the job that you want you're trying to impress a person versus coming with shorts and flip-flops and your hair not done you wouldn't do that so this is how we show up to the world now there comes a point in which
so much of you shows up as this Persona versus the real person and you start to move away from who you are so we have to be careful when we're trying to manage our impression that we don't become someone else or something else does that make sense okay very good because we're very good at sniffing out inauthentic Brands okay so at the very top of this this is where the designers get all confused is like the logo that's the brand isn't it well that's part of it the colors the visual aspects the identity the type faces used how you uh the collateral all the logo
and ass signage that it's printed out yeah that's part of it but much deeper than that is the brand right The Voice the behavior the beliefs and the values how you create your customer experiences so we're going to talk about that now when I talked to Hector and Carlos earlier not today but earlier they're like Chris talk about positioning we want to understand positioning so I have a lot to talk about in positioning so we understand what brand is brand is a person's got feeling it's not what you say it is it's what they say
is we know what branding is it's impression management how we influence people's perceptions of us we want to be true not inauthentic so then now what is positioning positioning is what the I told you it was going to get harder you stand in that industry how you kind of position your name others that's a pretty good pretty good general definition I like that how you match a brand how you put it how you put it out there
okay how you show up how you show up okay okay so I was trying to describe to somebody and then I looked it up it's much better if I just look it up positioning is the space that you occupy in the hearts and minds of your customers this is the important part relative to your competitors you have to introduce the concept of competitors it's not just you say what it is okay it's what you say it is and what how they feel and how they perceive you relative to your competitors and it's important understand
that because we're going to start to take this apart so we're in a room full of accountants so it's going to be hard for us to stand apart but you all have a competitive Advantage now from everybody who's not in this room today you understand that right Hector and team are pushing you to think outside the box to go outside of your comfort zone to incorporate new ways of thinking new ways of building and hopefully now I'll help you think about new ways of showing up as your brand so position can be a tricky concept to understand and I was reading
the book it's called positioning from the guys who coined the term positioning I think it's Al re and Jack trout art of reframing so just think about reframing we talked a little bit about reframing yesterday right and the way I try to describe it to to Young designers reframing is this if you take a piece of canvas and you spill paint on it and you try to sell that piece of canvas it's probably not going to sell for a lot but if you put that piece of canvas on a wall and
gallery and you put a beautiful frame around it and a Red Velvet Rope around it that same piece of art becomes worth much more so it's how you frame something determines how you perceive it and what you feel about it okay so just remember reframing just think of like the literal frame we move it somewhere else we change the frame we change the meaning so when we're trying to position ourselves what we want to do is we want to pick a fight we want to know who our competitors are so that we can say we are different than them
and one very effective and it's almost dirty way of doing this is to use some gorilla Warfare you make your competitors strength all of a sudden through reframing as a weakness when I read the book I was like these are dirty Gorilla Marketing tactics and it's wonderful it's it's nefarious if you think about it so Listerine everybody here know Listerine yes you have a perception of lerine so when scope wanted to enter the market liserin was the dominant
mouthwash brand so when we think of Listerine what do you associate Listerine with burning fres medicine freshness alcohol alcohol okay so I took some Liberties so we think of lerin as this really strong powerful thing that kills germs it's medicinal it feels old to me too and it's like it burns Okay so
when when lisine runs ads this is what they write it's the taste people hate twice a day so they Embrace that it's bad and it's true you want to lean into who you are here's another one from them you can handle it germs can't you are tougher than the germs so you see like this is a pretty good positioning for them right we're going to dominate the market by showing people that we're really strong we're very serious and then
of course kills germs that cause bad breath so if you're a new upstart and you're trying to wedge your way into the hearts and minds of consumers when they're thinking about mouthwash as scope did you've got to attack the dominant brand so here's all they did they took what they already said and they reframed it when I click on this you'll see how it works and how dirty this Warfare is no more medicine breath and then scope jumped into the market and started to capture like 33% of the market it's incredible from zero
to that they just picked a fight okay I'm going to show you two more examples is it starting to make sense now this is positioning you have to think about where you live relative to your competitors so Coca-Cola the classic all right so what do we associate the original the one and only and and Coke I don't know if you know this but in the 80s there was like the Cola Wars right Coke versus Pepsi you guys are old enough I can see you we're there too I'm not calling you old I'm old just like you okay
so there was this moment where it felt like Coke and Pepsi were neck and neck choice of new generation people preferred uh Pepsi in a blind taste test all that kind of stuff because they made a critical mistake Pepsi is now number three in the coal Awards you know who number one is Coke who's number two Dr Pepper what Coke Zero Diet Coke that's how dominant they are Coke is the number one brand Diet Coke just the same thing with
without sugar is number two and they made a critical mistake they chase Trends Pepsi's tagline in 80s was the choice of the new generation you have to spend so much money to chase Trends so they use celebrities to endorse them what did Coke do they just leaned on it's the real thing baby the real thing the original isn't that interesting Pepsi chased something Coke leaned into who they were okay so it's the real thing that's their tagline
so when you're seven up and you want to wedge your way into the Cola Wars what are you going to say it's just like that take what they're known for and reframe them so when you're tired of doing what everybody else is doing why don't you give this a try and I love this I had to go into like the archives and dig this up the unnown isn't that good yes okay and then there's my
Microsoft circuit 2006 they're the dominant standard you know they're crushing the business world they're the thing that all serious professional business people use so before Apple became Apple in its reinvention of it they reposition the PC with This brilliant campaign and I read that this campaign irritated Bill Gates so much that Steve would do this to his company you remember I'm a Mac I'm a PC so they reposition this dominant
business force that captured 97% of the market at that time as old out of date bloated mess whatever it is uncool unhip and this really irritated Bill Gates so you know the advertising is working when the CEO is upset so that's positioning or repositioning so just take a minute to think about this when you're trying to position your company your brand how are you going to be different relative to your competitors when we think of
accounting firms what are the big dogs that you have to fight against who PWC PWC okay P okay so you you know who they are do you know what the brand stands for what they're known for there you go Partners screwed up people that enter into it they get CRA yeah it's a big faceless organization Maybe
and you're just going to be one of many suit suits look like the PC there you go you could just steal this campaign I'm a I'm a small accountant that's PWC so you what you do is you reposition them you reframe it okay that's how you do it okay uh so when you when you're trying to figure out how to do reposition you have to identify who is it that you're really competing against seriously when somebody's looking at you who are they considering other than you you can't get to
too aspirational with this cuz it won't work because it has to resonate with that person all right so when you identify the compet competition ask them ask yourself what are they known for the top three traits this helps if you're super observant it also helps if you're not how to use chat gbt you just write it in there okay and then the last part of this is to be anti whatever they are be the opposite of them so you're going to ask people to make a choice do you want that big faceless thing or do you want
someone who's going to care about your business who's going to stay up late at night worrying if you're going to make payroll which do you want I'm not saying that's you I'm just talking out loud here okay okay so if we go on here the purpose of position is to reduce or outright eliminate competition when you're clear with what who you stand for who you stand against and what you're about your beliefs and your values and you behave in a consistent way that's the point because we know
when you're a company of one you don't compete on price anymore you command a premium so many of us that are in this Professional Service space we mistakenly believe that we'll win the the project by making it easy for them and in fact what we want to do is we want to make it harder one of the harder the way that you make it harder to work with you is you create scarcity and you signal to the market I'm worth it there's a premium Now I want to pay more and I will wait in line to work with you
the room got really Gloom for some reason what happened was it yes command a premium I think we didn't get quite isn't that obvious though not always really talk to me about that um I think because a lot of times the first thing that comes to our head is price especially in our industry yeah and I think when you're going to command a premium you have to really believe your premium and there's Industries where we struggle with that everybody
struggles with how they believe in themselves so should we just throw away the deck and talk about mindset self confidence confidence it's all about it is you know here's the thing about confidence though like what comes first the price of the confidence confidence it's up to you actually it's a trick question yeah I'm going to just tell you I'm sorry I'm going to run out of time we're I'm going to tell you a really quick story
okay I love helping people there's no time limit don't say that to me 4 hours later you're like yo don't get off the stage okay no time limit as long as my foot holds up and Hector says it's okay I go a little over okay thank you Godfather okay all right I'm tell you a little story right so I love helping people and when I started making content of course people all over the Internet would just write and ask questions like answering and then I found out there's no time left to do any work I can't make new content all I'm doing is answering questions so the way
I stop people from asking me questions because I have a hard time saying no I'm a people pleas I'm middle child I'm I'm there I know I know you feel me okay all right okay we're there all right so I have a hard time saying no so I'm like what am I going to do so I'm talking to my friend her name is Carrie and she works with a lot of coaches she pays a lot for coaching I've got limited experience with it she goes just charge them I'm like okay how much should I charge Carrie and she's like I don't know I'm like um 250 an hour what do you think she she goes
if you charge anything less than $500 an hour I would not respect you anymore I'm like damn all right but I was feeling really guilty about that if I charge $500 an hour I think these poor people on the internet are not going to be able to afford me so I create the the the the link on the page and I'm like okay 500 bucks an hour and then when anybody asked me for a piece of advice I would just like here click on this link and then they stopped asking it was a beautiful thing it solved my problem it prevented me from having to say no because I gave them the choice the
Choice was you want advice you pay if you don't want advice no problem God bless you take care be well and so what worked originally stopped working because I got booked too much so my time was all now taken up by doing these $500 things so I'm like that's not going to work I'm going to change it to 750 an hour and I think back in my days as working as a professional I would pay someone $750 a day and feel guilty for paying them that much money and here I am I'm asking them for 750 an hour so of course people stop calling
beautiful problem solved again except for they started booking me again I'm like this is just too little now I'm gonna go to $1,500 an hour same thing happened no one calls then everyone calls so it's happening too much because coaching somebody oneon-one is mentally very exhausting I have to take a nap afterwards okay so I'm like that's it I'm tired of this $5,000 an hour I know you're like this guy this guy who does he think he is well who's going to pay for the Louie you see what I'm saying
that's I just priced so I can go shopping you understand okay I know you can connect with that all right okay so of course now no one calls it's like crickets but it's a positioning play I change it to $5,000 an hour because I don't want them to book me I want them to buy a course or book me for an event so they can see the value at $1,500 an hour if I'm charging $10,000 for a course like why don't we just book you seven times it's better than this other thing it's a positioning play I'm forcing them
okay and then recently somebody booked me for 5,000 bucks an hour I'm like damn this is good life is good okay so price does communicate position so you have to be bold enough to say I'm worth this much and maybe some of you are not worth that much today and all you have to do is you have to close the gap you develop what it is that you're doing you upskill you provide better service or you're more lenient when they ask for a little change here and there and we were talking about this last night at the party
it's like how do you know you're going to be uh profitable I said charge so much it doesn't even matter if they want to ask for something do it you know Blen would say this to me he's like charge enough money it's called the like the Friday night phone call at 6 PM or something if the phone rings at 6 pm on Friday and you can have call or ID are you happy to pick up the phone are you happy to pick up the phone now most of you are Friday 6 p.m. you're encroaching my personal space there's no boundaries but if you charge enough I pick up the phone how you
KN what do you need how can I help you is everything okay so I want to be put in that place where I don't care anymore what you ask me for and I'm not going to count the hours I don't even care I don't want to do time sheets I don't want to measure anybody by the hours in which they work I only care about the outcome make sense all right premium pricing so you go shopping remember that okay let's talk a little bit about marketing okay so we talk about branding brand positioning what is marketing I love Seth godden's definition
of this and it's a beautiful way and and I think it's a different way than what we assume of marketing now a lot of people think marketing is advertising and advertising is marketing advertising is one tactic of marketing and advertising is like putting out a message on repeat invading your space over and over where you don't want it to creep up that's advertising and advertising for a long time had worked it doesn't work anymore so Seth definition is marketing is generous Act of helping people get what they want not what you want it's the generous Act of
helping people get what they want with no expectations so he goes deeper so do something that matters for people who care so you have to find a group of people who are very passionate about something people are very passionate about hot sauce right they do there's a whole store in San Francisco all they have are hot sauce are people passionate about ketchup not so much not so much that's why there aren't 85 varieties people are very
very passionate about coffee they'll go to war in fact Duncan Nance um they came up with an ad that they're just called Duncan now against Starbucks you know what their ad was friends don't let friends drink Starbucks I know reframe attack you can see this now it's like I've given you I don't know if it's the red pill but once you take the pill you can't unsee the stuff anymore so as you drive around you see Billboards or you're watching TV or you f
through a magazine pay attention to how they're speaking to you they understand you have a relationship with someone and they're home recers they come in and they wreck the relationship it's like cheaters they just wreck it okay so if we go a little bit deeper oh I'm sorry so sell to people who actually want to hear from you versus interrupting people who don't that's the key people are looking for you right now people who need you who desperately want some help from you so pay attention to them versus the people you have to chase
it goes on to say you know permission marketing is an invitation like people volunteer to to participate in a long-term marketing campaign of increasing value it's a strange way to frame marketing isn't it permission marketing is where people volunteer to participate in a long-term marketing campaign of increasing value so first they meet you you have to deliver some value and as they go deeper and deeper into the relationship before they buy from you you're giving them
more and more value so that's when the S is happening in throughout that entire process so what you have to do is you have to develop a marketing curriculum think of it like an educator you have General broad information that excites them and then you go deeper and deeper to the point in which you can give them that super detailed high value stuff because they're not ready for it up front but they'll need it at the end so there's three components to permission marketing it's is this anticipated am I looking forward to this is it personal and relevant
to me if it is then you're doing permission marketing correctly so there's um do you guys have you ever built a customer Journey map before okay um I I found the simplest explanation of this using three uh five letters a i DCA a i DCA and it's a variant to how you write headlines which is Aida so the first thing you need to do is like how do I build awareness
and when they become aware of my products or Services what do I need to do to capture their interest and as they go deeper and deeper into your marketing curriculum how do I create desire what what kind of transformation is that they want and then you get into conversion now most people stop there I got the sale it's great but what what we all know is it's very hard to get a client it's easier to keep one so when you get a client you have to think about what is it I need to do to deliver Delight
such that they're so compelled to tell other people about what it is that I do that I've created an experience an emotional thing for them that resonates with them that they want to go and tell every single person every person in this room has done this before where you've experienced something magical with a product or service and you feel so compelled to go on social media and share and tell all your friends somebody's coming in at from out of town where should I eat oh you got to go to this dist place where should I stay only stay here never stay there you want to be that brand
such that people are so passionate about what it is that you do that they tell their other business friends you need to work with Mary or Bob or Kate okay I think Ron and Hector had touched on this already the purpose of a business is to do something right the purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer Peter drer so there's a there's a little framework here I want to share with you about how you can start to understand brand and branding so that you have some clear actionable things I'm doing
pretty good on the slides here I think I I shouldn't say it because I always speak too soon okay so so what we need to understand is it always starts with a customer we talked about this a little bit yesterday about who is a customer and we have to create a new customer if we want to be an Innovative company it's very difficult to sell or create a product to to a customer who doesn't want what you do it's very difficult you're not that persuasive I don't have those persuasive skills myself either and so oftentimes we think when we create a
a customer Avatar customer profile we focus too much on their demographics like their age their income their title where they live all the kind of data driven things but what we have to do is we have to get into the psychographics or beliefs values opinions because that shapes more of what we do than the other stuff okay I'm not going to spend time working on the customer profile or the buyer Persona or whatever because you can literally go on chat GPT and type that up have you guys done that before you haven't
it's wonderful okay I don't know the resource right now but there's a gentleman who's gone through and created some incredible scripts that there's um a plugin that you can get all you have to do is tell it what you make and what city and it creates the most incredible customer profile it's wild it is wild and and he made a YouTube video of this and I tested I was like wow this is pretty cool but you can literally type in to chaty BT
um create a user Persona customer profile buyer Persona something like that for someone who's looking for an accounting service in uh Tampa who is female over 40 and give it some information Don't Let It Go Wild on you and see what it says and if that Rings true to you then you can just use that as the foundation it's going to already identify the demographics and psychographics for you because chat already knows how to do this
so the the framework looks something like this like oops let me go back one sorry so this is one way if you you can look at it understand your customers what value that you're going to create for them the transformation the change that you're going to create the result and then you just need to add two things the tone of voice and the look and feel so if I lay it like this it's a little bit easier to understand okay yes yes the value prop in our industry
like can I he your value for you or what it means to you when you what what you say sure I'll take a whiteboard um okay if you understand the needs of the customer the transformation they seek in their life the pain points their challenges then your your value prop is going to be the solution to that we're building bridges so you have a the current state which you're in all of you are in a current state right now
right and then there's the desired State what is your desired State everybody we'll do this together is this a marker that works yeah take the take the ones that I'm not allowed to write with okay okay so you have current state and you have desired state or desired future State okay and there's usually something that's blocking them you can think of this as a wall something like that okay what is happening let's just talk about the people
in this room a couple days ago you were not here you're doing what you do you've taken time off work your family your life to be here because you desire some kind of transformation yes okay what transformation do you desire now I'm opening can of worms because maybe the workshop is align towards us or it's not I don't know but we would start here okay so let's talk about that everybody can see this okay it's a good spot for it okay so you're here you're an accounting firm I assume almost all of you there's a couple anomalies in the room there's
a realtor and a graphic designer I think okay what is the desired future State why did you come here what is it that you wanted to happen in your life sub subscription you want to understand subscription models I want to be subcription model yes and what are you right now um what's commonly known as value prices monthly pricing monthly pricing really how's that different subscription is scopeless
and what I do is scop okay so you so there's just I think a small difference then except the big price okay can you share okay I'm to in trouble I saw Ron over there now I'm all nervous I'm like damn I'm going to say something he's like Yo dude that's not correct that's factually incorrect right now he's going to cancel me all right I'm going to pretend like he's not here and Ron and Hector Hector is not here either okay so we'll just say things that I get in trouble
get a refund okay I already got paid so monthly pricing what do you charge for monthly pricing on a typical client 1500 1500 okay there's no reaction in the room it's like woo or good good that's pretty good pretty good she doing all right we'll shop later depends it depends 1500 bucks a month and there's scope right and so I think Ron's like if you can do something there's unlimited scope okay what price would you
have to charge so that you don't care what they ask for is that enough okay that's a big jump people already impress of the 1500 you're going for a 10K she going for the kill I like that okay so let me ask you something what's stopping you from doing this today confidence okay anything else um to some extent a knowledge I have extensive extensive knowledge but not can we get her the mic please yes sir thank you
oh confidence knowledge what else it's not yeah but I have I don't have accounting accounting knowledge I have lots of business experience and and confidence but the accounting part throws me are you the legal in tax person no oh sorry I'm all confused everything but I do not do tax or legal okay okay so confidence and knowledge okay yeah how will you acquire this knowledge going to conferences reading going to conferences reading listening
conferences okay what do you need knowledge in again accounting you're not an accountant depends who you ask what's your definition today who do you want me to be I mean it's I didn't know it was going to be that kind of conversation bookkeeping to accounting and people are you know wait is that the same thing no okay let's talk about it all right we'll make this so it's relatable to everybody you want something you can't get it what are what are barriers to you getting that and then so
you're going to seek out Solutions so I'm going to assume that Hector and Carlos have designed a curriculum for you in the last or the day and today so that you're going to get that knowledge piece that you need the confidence is going to have to come from some other place okay now I've been thinking about this a lot about confidence I think what happens is when people say they need confidence they need something very specific do you know what they need do need more experience
what do they need Val validation how do you get validation you got to do it so it's a chicken and egg thing again that's problematic taking a risk so I've been thinking about this and you guys tell me if I'm thinking about it correctly because I'm not even convinced myself which is I think we're all just looking for permission from somebody it's really weird it's like when we say we want confidence it's like somebody in your life is going to say you can
can do what's your name again Teresa somebody's going to say Teresa you got this girl you don't need all this other stuff just ask for it so for me in my story luckily it kind of ties together here I was like I'm going to just give away my advice for free and car's like no you're not so she gave me permission to charge to feel okay about the guilt that or shame that I have for charging people for things I want to do for them and it just took that initial push there's nothing real or tangible about it just some fool says go ahead and do this you
donkey I'm like okay I'll do it yeah right so you're waiting for that permission from somebody who is that somebody well then why are you holding yourself back that's what we do yeah like this is like a an AA meeting now huh yeah you know I love that I love you that you say it's the industry did the industry call you last
tonight didn't did the industry send you a book and say do not do this no but the thing is that we are framed into that industry uh like wheel every single day and we are just in our brains we have that chip Incorporated so if you're not a CPA then you're not you don't have that confidence or you're not confidence enough okay well that's attainable though you just go to school and you can get your CPA sure but you you still have that business running
you know what I mean like it's no okay so wait wait hold on before you take off my time because I'm just mindful of time I just want to say this this happens everywhere I go they said it can't be done and every time I'm like who they who they and no one can name the they the they do not exist you know who they are you you see that person every single day you look at this person in a mirror it's you I have design students like Chris I didn't know we could do this when somebody else does something Innovative I'm like well who told you you couldn't do it
well we were told this I'm like who who Who's the they they can never name the they I'm going to make a shirt who they and you understand it gives us permission to not go for what we want and we accept it from our colleagues but we shouldn't we should do what we know we should do you know the thing about creative folks they don't live in the real world they live in the world of their imagination and then the real world aligns to that
are you creative I'm yes I'm marketing I all my okay go marketing yes it works yes you all are yes you all are so let's get rid of the day you can do whatever it is you want you can say you know it's going to be 10 grand and you can get a lot of NOS just like I got a lot of NOS until you get a yes and you're like what took me so long what permission whose permission was I seeking so give yourself the permission slip say I can do this I will do this I'm doing it now I I
talked about this this morning decide and you will be decide and you will be stop letting someone else tell you what you are decide it and be it fake it till you make it okay let me ask you guys this question okay would you prefer to be in this state of charging $1,500 an hour or or whatever a month and then people are asking you for a little extra you're like uh that's out of scope we don't have clear boundaries I need to charge you more do you want that kind of relationship
or would you rather just charge whatever you're going to charge and attract the kind of person is like you know what I have a $3 million problem $10,000 a month ain't nothing please take care of my business so I can sleep better at night take care of my business so that I don't have to like tell my wife things aren't working or my husband the business is broken what kind of relationship do you want see so this is a really weird thing and it's hard for I think for some of you to understand this when you charge so much money you attract a different kind of buyer a buyer believes in you
so that when you say uh jump over that fence they just jump because it cost them so much to talk to you they're just going to do it so you're creating that barrier for people who aren't Believers and the price is that barrier there's other things you can do but I'm going to keep moving on here all right you're welcome you're welcome okay so when we look at this like what is your value prop what kinds of solution
you're going to provide to people the benefits the impact that you're going to create and that's an emotional Thing versus the feature so many of us get caught up in the feature it's like well you have access to someone 24 hours a day that's a feature sleep better at night that's a benefit uh having a Clear Vision for the future that's a benefit getting your spouse off your back that's a definite benefit okay so I'm going to show you some example or an example here okay so
remember this diagram we're going to go back here just remember this if you want to take a picture of it because we want to move forward and then you're going to see how this plugs in I'm going to show you one example here when take it through and then I'm almost out of time okay so the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle company is a very clear brand it's an iconic American brand or it used to be so I'm going to ask you this question what is the value proposition the primary benefit to the customer think emotional not logic
status what kind of status can you expand whoever said status who said status okay status what kind of status what are we talking about amongst their peers but can you articulate we understand status amongst our peers but what kind of status is it uh they're cool they they're cool okay cool yeah I'll work with that okay let's keep going let's bounce around it's a community what kind of community you can go to any
City and you know there's a Harley Davidson store and you can wear a harleydavidson shirt anywhere like oh yeah I've been to that City okay all right go ahead I just the other day um Harley came up beside us at a stoplight my husband and I Harley came up at the light on the other side and they did this it was we used to do that junior high do you still do that it's like what's up what's up right
we we can't boys will still be boys you can't get rid of that like a club it's a club it is fingers as we pass people put your two you put your two fingers as you ride by other Riders come the other way that's I love that how you say it with your accent say it one more time what say what how to ride by and give it that away did she did she say it like that or yeah she did I love that I'm celebrating you thank you thank you okay so here's what I know about
Harley Davidson motorcycles I've never been on a motorcycle they're freaking loud and obnoxious they say look at me and hear me as I come and as I go and when it's 3: in the morning I'm like God dang it I'm trying to sleep here right so like I don't give an f what you think that's their attitude so here's here's the value prop it's a form of self-expression on two wheels it's the promise of Adventure this Freedom this Independence like it takes us back to maybe when we're riding horses like cowboy
and cowg girls roaming the PLS right Outlaw culture everybody tries to dress a certain way leather spikes skulls Mohawks whatever tattoos topl toplet okay that's a different conference okay you know they they're going to fight the system like Stick it to the Man we're going to reclaim the road these are all the value props and it definitely makes a loud statement literally and figuratively
make sense notice no horsepower no 0 to 60 no nothing that's the value prop when you understand what triggers us to buy it's emotional so we have to speak the language of emotion because when you speak that all of a sudden something happens inside of us like you get me you understand me okay how does the brand sound to the customer so what is the tone of voice tough we're out of ideas
that was tough act to follow somebody else L loud for sure rall rule Challenger rule breaker maybe criminal like we got to go to the extreme right Outlaws Robin Hood helping others while they're breaking I don't get that from a Harley-Davidson person but if you if you say so that's fine indant indignant okay all right so what we want to do is
when you're working on your brand you want to come up with a bunch of words and we don't judge we just create and part of the exercise usually is you write as many words as possible without fear of judgment so you write a 100 words what's our tone of voice what's our value prop so I just made up some it's the tone of voice is controversial rebellious we want to challenge the status quo edgy Outlaw hardcore defiant unconventional and you want to skip the easy words the
first 10 words that you come up with are going to be super generic so you got to push past the generic words so the idea usually when we facilitate this with companies is whatever words they write the first 10 we just cross them off and say we cannot use those words because they'll say like Innovative right like every company's Innovative all of a sudden come on push pass the p a okay what does the brand look and feel like so now we get into the visual aspects and we try to come up with words that are visual that you can translate into a language
so here we say like maybe it's distress it's raw this unpolished unvarnished thing it's authentic Counter Culture rugged American masculine and unpretentious sort of so then what we do is we go back to our list and we pick the two words the two words that we feel like most resonate with what we're trying to do so here's the list again just to show you how this works this is like one of those cooking shows like I already made the pizza for you okay so
I just chose two words like rebellious and passionate that would be the tone of voice for Harley-Davidson then when we looked at the the look and feel we say distress and counterculture make sense so far all right cool you see the diagram now so here's the value prop self-expression the promise of Adventure and Freedom the voice and the tone or tone of voice is is rebellious and passionate and the looking feels distress counterculture so you might be sitting there thinking um so what is
does that look like man so this is the beauty of the internet you just gather images and you start to curate and sort out what that looks like so you build a mood board and if I click it I should build so if you if you employ designers or people are more visually oriented you give them those two words and say hey go on Pinterest or behance or Instagram and just find things that capture this feeling and they're going to come up with a bunch of images some fit some don't don't worry that's part of the process
and then through what you guys do you curate like this feels right to me and then you elate the others and if you don't have enough you say these ones really feel right find more and they can do that and so through this process of curating and opening it up and and Contracting it you'll find and land on a visual language and then you can search for some other images photography Styles yeah it does I I just look for images that follow the words right okay
so we're going to put this together now and one of the things that we sort of dipped into Yesterday is the language like language transform so choosing the right language and coming up with words to to redefine things so when you study Cults and Brands and brand tribes they're very cult-like a brand cult right uh somebody recommended I watch this series you don't need to watch it it's it's a series on Netflix called how to become a cult leader I watched it it's horrible
and amazing at the same time okay cuz you're trying to build a cult-like connection with people except for you're benevolent you're not going to steal people's money but one of the things I saw was they have a secret language to let you know you're in the cult right and if every brand that you're interested in study the language that they use and you'll start to see this so in one of the Cults um what is the the group where they all like committed suicide cuz they thought they're going to go to the spaceship and they weren't
Nikes Heaven's Gate so the Heaven's Gate people devises it's kind of diabolical how they did this they started to redefine words that we use this is not your body it's a vessel and they would describe everything this is not your brain this is not your soul it's something and they had a new word for everything and when the people used the words that they created they knew they were in and this is what brands do you notice how like um Adidas their soul technology they don't just call like Soul they call
adiprene and Nike has like uh all kinds of words for like their Technologies their Fabrics there's two things that are valuable one is you make people use your language and two you can trademark it or patent it and it's valuable so now you have IP so if you created some kind of framework or system for accounting or the way that you diagnose a client's problems business problems give it a name the name should relate to your brand make sense so now you're creating brand assets all right
The Secret Language and so this agency uh called wolves they created this campaign that I thought was really clever and they use this hashtag roll your own clearly there's a play on words here you guys know what I'm talking about right don't all be all innocent with me roll your own so this is one of the ads they have so this to a Harley-Davidson owner is a morning donut see they
make something you know and they reframe it as something else and it speaks two languages there it's pretty clever so the little copy says Raise Hell before lunch so they're reinforcing that raise hell these are troublemakers that are lawyers who make mid6 figures you know what kind of Outlaw is that okay here's another one lap dance right so lap dance we associate with a certain thing they reframe it as something totally different yeah the LA
you get it you know marot most people just do that in their mind I love that you just say it out loud I love that I love that you need to be in every audience that I'm at and bring 35 of your friends okay so it's like Place mom told you not to go lap dance again the play on words and it's done with such few like an economy of words it's beautiful here's the last one the black market okay and and the line here
I need to read this to you it says 99 bucks any less and you could be arrested see the language in which they use cuz this is Outlaw criminal culture it's not real but it's what you want to feel you know mid mid midlife crisis it's like oh I need to do something all right so I have one more example to share with you um and it's the ugly truth about being ugly okay so I normally never go grocery shopping my wife does I sit in the car and the reason why I sit in the car is cuz she don't want to be rough
rushed this just the way it is I'm like babe you want this what's your list I got you she goes you're ruining this I want to enjoy this I'm like enjoy what what is there to enjoy the experience you clearly don't understand so I actually went in one day and was like I think it was a Whole Foods it was a Whole Foods and I'm walking by and I just see this like display of nuts and fruit dried fruit and something spoke to me I walked by this package just hello I'm ugly and first I said
I I read it as you ugly so it's I stopped like you talking to me you know I knew I should have wor the shirt I knew it so I started picking up the package I started reading it and I was just in just infatuated with this thing the way it spoke to me I had to buy it I I could not leave the store without buying this thing now I'm going to read to you what's on the package and I want you to tell me what's working this is the last thing I'm going to get off the stage okay so here we go and before that I'm going to just ask you to think about three things um there's a guy name
is Brandon Kane he wrote this book hooko he grew a million followers in one month I got to interview him and he shared all these Concepts some of it white hat some of it black hat some gray hat but whatever so the thing that he says is people process things the majority of people process things through facts feelings and fun so if you only give them facts you're leaving out two-thirds of the population if you're only doing fun or feelings you're leaving every out so you try to in your messaging in your videos in your communication to include
three things you have the best chance of grabbing the broadest audience into your content make sense so if you're posting content like did you know Uncle Sam did this and it's 2.7% you've lost two-thirds of the population but do you know if you do this you can actually go buy that house boat or whatever you wanted to buy oh you brought some fun back into it now imagine your kids jumping off the deck of that house boat that's a feeling so you bring those three things together and you can communicate to the brightest
group of people all right so I'm going to read this to you I want you to pay attention to the three FS facts fun feelings yeah and I'm going to ask you some questions here so pay attention I know you guys are very good at test taking here we go this does not work well with designers so I'll read the copy beautiful on the inside 100% upcycled peaches ugly fruit is thrown out because of the way it looks but you should never judge a fruit by its cover you are preventing 2 and a/4 pound
of ugly fruit from becoming waste because more peaches are thrown away in California than the state of Georgia produces annually that's think about that pit happens well we do our best to remove all the pit traces from our product sometimes Mother Nature just won't let go okay that's the copy so how did the ugly company that's what they're called turn an unremarkable boring ho
product into a charismatic brand so I'm going to ask you these questions now okay and this meant to be interactive who do you think they are targeting and why because we start with a customer who are they targeting and why based on what I just read to youal environmentalists yeah envir yeah people that are health conscious uh what climate conscious you know all these yeah those people those people nature freaks nature freaks the lip tards
is that what we're talking about here Tree Huggers okay people like don't feel like they fit in why do you say that um because um the on the first you have to go back a couple slides you have to remember um just you know beautiful on the inside ugly on the outside okay did that speak to you no I'm
she's like I mean we can all identify with that on what is your name Rachel stand up Rachel just spin around stand up stand up stand up stand up take come on stand up Rachel stand up spin around so everybody can see you okay this side to this side this side give him give him a full 360 okay so okay have a seat that's all we need you for so she's like honey are you seeing this clearly clearly not for me asking for a friend she says
some point in our lives can yes because maybe you're a late bloomer and maybe you never bloomed who knows we can relate to that don't judge a fruit by its cover they took a common expression don't judge a book by its cover and this is a powerful marketing message take things that people already know and just reframe it don't judge a fruit by its cover and we if you were ever bullied if you ever felt like left out made fun of Mean Girls you know
like I feel that that's a feeling there okay right here homeschooler moms what wait say say homeschooler moms what is it they targeting homeschooler moms yes that's very specific yes how come I'm a homeschooler mom are you projecting what's going on well I'm a homeschooler mom but I'm not your original homeschooler mom because I'm a more of a business and then I ended up in this cult we are a cult yes the county cult well yeah kind of if you go into the homeschooling Environ
you have to be like your brain has to be designed to wake up every morning and say I'm not damaging my kids I'm just helping them grow what are they doing to attract the non-traditional homeschooler mom well the whole idea behind it is that a homeschooler moms will go for something that is totally different than what is out there okay we don't go for the Doritos or the Cheetos we go for something that is totally different perfect okay let's take one more I was also thinking the silky mom
have you heard of this no the silky there's the silky mom the scrunchie mom the silky mom is the mom who uses disposable diapers who buys everything organic kind of building on what Vanessa was saying and then the scrunchie mom is the mom that doesn't care about screen time and gives the Doritos and there's also that's a crunchy mom and then the scrunchy mom but I think this is probably the silky or the scrunchy Mom that's really interesting cuz I'm neither a woman nor a mom and I I bought it is this weird
maybe I need to explore identifies she no I'm just kidding okay all right so let's keep going okay so we want to pay attention any time anything grabs your attention stop take a moment observe process analyze reflect because that's a lesson for you the whole world is your classroom this is what I do because I'm a dork I just see things I'm like oh that's what's what's happening to me right now what am I feeling why am I buying this and how do I tell this story and use this in other things how do I teach other people this here's the second question
how would you describe the vibe of the ugly company it's fun hipster hip in your face in your face mindful mindful those are excellent so we can reverse engineer the brand right now to a culture it says nothing added nothing added it talks to this culture that I grew up with when it was like no GMO no gluten like glutenfree and this and that and everything is like water instead of having some
so right it's nothing okay beautiful you see how this game works here I got a couple more questions for you what choices in design color and typography reinforce this Vibe so there's a Vibe A vibe is a feeling so now we need to connect it to something more tangible we have to check in with ourselves and this is something that happens a lot it's not just you guys we project you're a homeschooled mom so you're like it's for homeschooled moms you see how that works some tech bro will be like it's for Tech Bros so we have to make sure that our observations are connected to things
things that we actually see so we can deconstruct and create our own recipe makes sense right okay so what is it that they've chosen to do just with the visual aspects that communicate you about this vibe that they have it's bright font it looks like what looks like a it looks like a peach okay cuz it's peach colored yeah the font is very pretty for the word ugly yes so it's a jxap position this is really
important there's playing to type and there's playing against type have you heard that expression before so they're playing against type right now yes okay it's kind of interesting how she interpreted that she had a whole voice in a Persona change did you see that hello hello I'm ugly can you help me can you help it's like yeah well the choice innocent you're a little innocent yeah cuz it's this mon
line cursive script type face that they're using so now we know the type faces that you choose have personality this is why you need to hire designers by the way because you don't know this there a secret language we all understand okay so be very conscientious like why am I feeling this right now what is it that's happening to me the really cool thing is you don't have to be a designer to be able to do any of this you just go find a brand a package that you like go to airan go to Whole Foods go to one of those upscale ones where
they really curate the packages and the products that they sell something speaks to you just take it and deconstruct it and make your brand like that I I actually give this assignment to people literally do this right I I can't remember but there was a a coffee company that was like death coffee I'm like that's the interesting they had this crazy visual language with skulls on I'm like let's go and there's liquid death there's all kinds of stuff right just find a package cuz the package has lots of things has colors textures uh it has Type faces and it has a language and a tone of
voice take it deconstruct it use it you don't have to reinvent this stuff okay all right I'm going to skip this um so was there a line of copy that you connected with yes which one beautiful beautiful on the inside okay so I would have bought it just to see what it's beautiful on the inside okay that's good just remember that yeah like what's up is
there there's a lot of intentionality behind this isn't there it just didn't like fall out of like word you know what I mean or Excel somebody really thought this through yes the word ugly is the prominent thing ugly is prominent it's it's actually taking a weakness and making it a strength you see that right there okay so this thing that you said must be beautiful on the inside I'm going to tell you right now you want to say something oh just also just the Beautiful on the inside they've got they've got the arrows pointing
directly at it which are maybe the direction to rip it open but also focuses your attention on the Beautiful on the inside so see me hey good pickup on that is are you the first gentleman to use the microphone today I believe you are well done we're representing the men in the room well done well done all right we feel seene okay you know what upcycled means no it's not wait let I want to her to sweat a little bit
I don't have the mic what is the difference between upcycled and recycled they're two different words for a reason because you're reusing it but not from trash no no all the all the granola women in here know exactly what upcycle means it's a different thing recycle you want to say it I know what I'm I believe I know um well they are can you hold the mic what's that hold the mic oh yeah well they're talking about uh how they throw away this fruit so
instead of throwing away they're app cycling they're they're yeah everybody's really smart when they don't have the microphone you know let her finish let her hangers up you know it's a you know they say one man's trash is another man it's another man's trash it's starting to fall apart right I don't know keep going that's what I believe um they're trying to say here they're upcycling the fruit I love this I love this you know
you you you you have a perception of accountants and you think they're all introverted they're not they grab the mic before they even have the answer I know you know what I mean I love this I I love it you know what I mean isn't this wonderful I know I know no yeah this this group of weirdos I love it okay recycle you use something it becomes trash and they pull it out of the trash and they re uh they break it down and renew it is a whole chemical process upcycles it doesn't even enter the trash we find a new life for it
okay so if you take a pair of shoes that are used you break it down there's a lot of energy and chemicals that have to happen before you could recycle it upcycles they never entered the trash to begin with it's a powerful concept upcycling okay somebody's like I knew it it was me I was going to say it is that is that what happened over here you okay I'm I'm like three hours over time let me just keep moving on okay remember they said beautiful on the inside
I opened it up it ain't beautiful at all okay it's remarkable not because of the product itself okay they're tiny little squares you're not getting big pieces of fruit because this is the stuff they throw away right okay I think Ron said this yesterday you're not selling your service you're selling an outcome they're not selling you their fruit they're selling you a feeling I feel better
when I buy this product it's good for you it's not healthy for your mind dried fruit is dried fruit okay and this dried fruit is pretty ugly okay so let's look at the strategy here you turn a weakness into a strength you turn into a whole brand you call yourselves ugly you don't avoid it right I used to live in Seattle above Pike's Market and there's a strip bar across the street and every day I look at
the window and they had this beautiful slug on says 39 beautiful women and one ugly one I was like there's truth in advertising here and that's compelling to me versus like the world's best you know I love that it's something like that right so they take trash and they turn into treasure that's what you're saying and they turn your guilt into gold I'm saying something else okay please share you're also okay I don't know if you know anything about the grocery
industry but everything in the in the produce section is artfully arranged and shiny and there's a lot of waste and so a lot of people don't want that so by buying this you're buying not that does that make sense you're buying not that what is that you're choosing you're you're choosing to not buy that conventional system of buying produce yes
we're saying the same thing I was trying where we're arguing here no listen I but I I didn't I don't know if if we caught that but um I think that like some per people purposefully try to avoid that type of thing so they'll only buy this um alternative kind of item is that is that what we're saying yes that's what we're saying okay okay when you go to Whole Foods and Air1 you're already stepping into people who already made that decision for you it's very hard it's the difference like between that
in Walmart or tar Shay you know it's very different that's why she likes to shop there she's like it's an experience babe I'm like okay I get you sort of I think computers and it's the same feeling I'm like okay I get you now all right so the three FS okay so we're going to show you fact fact feeling and fun 2.2 uh two and a qu pounds of waste that's a fact California throws out more peaches than Georgia makes peaches fact that's powerful I didn't know that Justin Bieber told me I get my peaches from
Georgia baby right and my weed from California okay and they they use this line sorry I'm in a mood judging on appearance judging on appearance man that's rough that's a feeling if you ever felt that way I'm going to connect it's going to resonate and then pit happens we know they don't mean to say pit happens they're just having a little fun they're like we don't take ourselves seriously neither should you all right so there you are turn a weakness into a strength oh sorry
personality they humanize their brand they connect with you it's just not another company that makes fruit I looked them up it's like some big dude like that you wouldn't expect that makes this it's his company and they make it super relatable and the reason why you need to do this is because Brands and personality okay my friend yo Santos who's a brilliant brander she said this people don't fall in love with corporations they fall in love with personalities I want to know there's a human behind that not a faceless entity
all right so here we are summary um number one get clear on who you serve you want to create a customer you want to keep the customer so what you need to do is you need to build a strong and Clear customer profile or a buyer Persona chaty PT can help you if you don't know how to do this and when you are able to create the Persona figure out what they want and what they need align your value proposition to the transformation to desired future state that they want
I see that you want this I see this is where you're stuck I'm going to deliver this to you it doesn't need to be more complicated than that they have a want and a need give them what they want a need and speak in a tone of voice that your audience resonates with match the look and feel and then last part the hardest part is to behave in a consistent manner throughout the entire customer Journey from the awareness stage to the conversion so they can become advocates for you so that
out there selling it for you how do I know this works the ugly company paid me exactly $0 to tell you their story to be their customer they paid me$ zerar and here I am on stages all over the world telling people their story that's how powerful a brand can be and I believe that's what you should want does that make sense is anybody out there telling your story on the stage no we have some I who said that yet I love it so she's ready she she don't need any more confidence she got it okay
okay so some resources you guys want it here it is and that's that's all I got so you won't take pictures cuz Hector said he'll give it to you right all right yeah thank you my time's up thanks everybody I just finished delivering my keynote into a wonderful receptive audience it's a room full of accountants by by their response and how they were laughing and participating you wouldn't even know so I think often times we put accountants in a very specific box they're quiet they're introverted they're very numbers and numbers driven and they don't have a sense of humor
nothing could be less true these guys were incredible they brought such great energy and they they went with me and they allowed me to play with them and I just enjoyed my time here the secret to everything that I was saying is you've got to be able to apply it so we become really good observers of life and study Brands and how they communicate and how they hook us in we're able to deconstruct that that we can apply it to ourselves so if you weren't able to make it to the conference I'm going to give you this one little hack go out to a high-end grocery store find a package a product or something that speaks to you the colors the topography the messaging and just buy that
go home consume it understand what what makes it what it is the messaging the design the topography the language and use that as a guide for your own brand you don't have to reinvent yourself you don't have to make new things a non-creative person can walk into the store find something that works and use that as a template or a foundation for what they're going to do do that this is what they come for they come to have a transformation be able to change their state you're in a box right now you need to get out of it and the only way that you can do that as far as I know is invest in yourself conferences workshops
books videos invest in yourself and create the kind of transformation that you desire


right so everybody today we have a special guest his name is Chris do and Chris is an Emmy award-winning director designer strategist and educator he's the CEO of blind which has been a pioneer in the motion design field and has made hundreds of ourn winning commercials music videos and broadcast promos that combine design typography animation live-action and visual effects for screens and clients of all sizes his firm's work has been recognized by many organizations such as the Emmys Huffington Post webby or London international awards he's also the executive producer of the school and the founder of the future which is an online education platform that beaches the business of design to create a fingers Chris also hosts the process which is a YouTube channel with over 500,000 subscribers almost and he lectures all over the world on the business of creativity and I'm very happy to have him here today so welcome Chris thank you very much is your name pronounced yawn
yeah it's yawn but you can call me Jen no I'll try to be yawn yawn so part of the mess everybody I'm in a construction zone right beyond this wall behind me is a lot of construction going on that's why there's the plastic tarp and everything so hopefully my video camera will hold up but I'm happy to talk to you yeah definitely so we're happy to have you here and we're gonna focus on pricing today especially and a lot of agency owners are listening so if we could just take it from like a high-level overview maybe you could define first what's the difference between kind of a person who's a order taker or an agency that's an order taker and somebody who actually can create value or charge premium what would be the difference for these two kind of entities okay there's a lot to unpack in your question there okay so the first thing about order taking and to some degree we all do order taking this is where somebody else tells you I want this this isn't done
they've diagnosed the problem themselves and they're prescribing the solution and they want you to execute on that and at some point all design gets to be in that space where you actually have to make something but if you want to have higher value conversations you can't be the order taker you have to be able to sit there and
say it's the problem we're trying to solve and then recommend to your client courses of action once you understand the problem and that's the thing that I tried and teach a lot of people is how to have that kind of conversation and what it is that you're listening for got it and so what I mean many people never get to move away from this order-taking mentality so how do you actually break this down because I know that I mean I work with agencies our clients are 100% agencies and we do lead generation for them and almost all of them are in this space this is basically very little differentiation just based on textile or maybe their services but nothing else so how do you start breaking this and move way to maybe charge more premium and move away from this order-taking to maybe creating like a value-based pricing structure and something along those lines so I think your motivation can't be purely based around money and the desire to make more money that's the net result of what happens that's a byproduct you get to charge more because what you're doing is more valuable so if you continue to do exactly the same thing the expectation of getting paid more or to being to be more part of the conversation around the bigger decisions and that's some kind of illusion that you're chasing ok so the first part is you need to recognize hey I'd like to change I want to grow I don't want to just always be doing this thing and if you're content making stuff building websites doing design building identities whatever it is that you do there's nothing wrong with that I'm not saying this in a judgmental way but if you desire to be more if you want to to change you want to evolve you have to acquire the skills to be able to do that the first thing that you need to realize is you got to switch away from being a sales and sales person and advocate for the kinds of things you do you have to become an advisor to help your clients achieve their goals and sometimes you have to act in the best interest of the client and not yourself what I mean by that so the client comes to you and says we need a website and and you do lead gen you have to say based on our understanding of what the problem is
you're absolutely right you need a website here's some numbers you can call you don't need me for this because this is not in my wheelhouse so you need to elevate yourself for
the person who is selling and advocating for yourself to one that's advocating for your clients best interest this is what consultants do they usually have a framework some kind of framework to ask the clients enough questions so that they can understand the problems and what they're doing is they're surfacing some insights for the clients to understand the reason why we're not getting this result is because we keep doing this thing if we're able to switch that there's a good chance we'll have a lot more success so what you're doing is you're opening up the conversation to solve a problem to achieve a desired future State
for example our marketing campaign is not performing Chris we need you to redesign the layout because it'll work then we want to use red in this typeface and new logos make it fresh and clean if you were the order taker you go and go and execute against that you provide lots of ideas and probably creatively do the best that you can but what if the hypothesis is incorrect
what if changing the graphics and making it look fresh and updated actually it's not the real problem and more often not that's the case it could be that we're targeting the wrong group of people so even if we do an amazing job and solve that problem we're not going to to move the needle for them this is where the strategic thinker is going to ask some questions say okay I understand that your campaigns are performing or underperforming how are they performing today let's establish a benchmark so that's our baseline okay so we're getting a conversion rate of two percent let's say the industry standard is 1% you can come right back at them and say there's nothing wrong with your conversion rate you're actually outperforming everybody by a margin of two and a percent in your sector I think you're looking for a problem that doesn't exist or they could just be super ambitious and say I want to go from two to four and then I would then ask them has anybody ever been able to achieve that kind of conversion rate and who is it can we learn something by looking at that so what I'm doing constantly is I'm challenging their observation checking to make sure it's grounded in reality and to see if we can find examples that we can reverse-engineer so that we're going to point them from this direction to a different direction so that's an example of the dialogue you would have
if you want to be a strategic consultant yeah
I think this is super important however one big problem I see even before this step is the inability of people to basically book a meeting like many of our clients what they've done they get a request for a website or something and basically it'll email the pricing like how in the hell can you sell over an email so you cannot actually create a value right these questions you will not be able to ask you cannot send the questionnaire it's all done so I think before this they actually have to realize there's certain steps in the sales process let's say and how would you break this down for you maybe let's assume that this person is able to get them on the initial call they found them on Behance you booked a Skype call and you're running through the initial call for the website project let's say so how do you what are they the core steps that you you do with your clients or with whoever you're advising to do on that initial call okay so there are different tiers that we need to attack here so the person who finds you on B hands the likelihood of them being a decision maker or a big client with a big problem is fairly low because that's not where big clients go to find talent this is where individuals go to find talent and there's a big difference there are exceptions of course because people do find us that way too but it's usually through a mixture of lots of different touchpoints that they're able to then reach out to us
so the preframe how they find you or how they discover you is really really important in terms of establishing that relationship so you don't have a website if you don't have a really great landing or sales page that talks about your process defines the problem defines a solution and then tells them about the services then the chance of you talking to a decision maker that is going to be a big sized business it's gonna be very low mm-hmm
well maybe we can assume a few things so of course there are different tires the referral is much easier than somebody called and somebody who found you on B hands so maybe this is like a start-up CEO they raise series a and they're looking to do I don't know
brand identity or the new website and everything and so he's a decision maker right it's not a huge company but he's a decision maker so how would you handle a call with that person
who can make a decision he's an entrepreneur
however you know he just fishing around probably so how are they find you doesn't matter so now we're yes no and we might be slipping into rope I know feel one coming on but I don't want to be presumptively I just want to define the steps before and then I'll try to go there
okay so startups historically should not spend any money on anything except for the absolutely essential thing which is to build a product or service something right so design typically is not one of those things unless you're designing the product if you're an app designer so we're talking about the traditional creative services like graphic design identity identity systems they need something how much money do you want to spend so this is one of the things that I'm talking about right now I want to illustrate this very clearly for you is this is that if I come to you and I want to spend a lot of money on identity design well that's fantastic if I'm at a dead end designer this is great news for me
but then I'm being an advocate for myself again and I'm not being an advocate for the clients business so the first thing I'm gonna ask them is this it's like why do you want to spend money on this shouldn't we be focusing on something else will this make an impact on your business so there's a couple of answers that can give you the most likely answer's no you're right thank you for saying this so many people want to just take my money and I feel like you are looking out for us so you have to say goodbye to business a lot of times if you're an advocate for them okay but in the chance that they say back to you like you know what thank you for bringing it up I appreciate that but Ashley our public perception and the way that we look is going to help us to on board Series B or other or whatever it is
so there's value to us so then then I can nationally proceed well if we do this right what kind of value would that provide to you Oh what investors will put more money into what amount four million dollars okay so at least now I understand it's a four million dollar problem that you're trying to solve
notice how I'm slipping right into the value-based conversation very organically versus forcing it to happen so if that's the case then we can say now the effort and the result are somewhat tied now because what you don't want to do is make a small effort for
result people mix that up all the time so if you're trying to raise four million dollars you're not going to spend $200 for the effort
they're just grossly out of alignment hmm
so then you can start to attach the thing that you do to what the client is trying to achieve so now we're gonna charge for the result and not for the effort and there's a big difference there got it
okay so there are a couple of couple of steps there and I think it's super useful I I do believe everyone is individual the startup has a different priority than a mid-sized company and an enterprise what I wanted to try is kind of a roleplay where I am actually the designer or the creative and you are the client which is kind of weird because I know you used to do it the other way around and I know it's it's a different kind of framework but I just want to show people that it's possible and maybe if we could try something where let's assume that you have a you have a website but you need to redesign and you're in the e-commerce niche and I'm the web designer you approached and you're one of the decision maker king of people in the mid-size organization maybe 500 employee company so not sure if that makes sense or okay to do what to redesign the e-commerce website during the e-commerce nation so it doesn't have to be super specific role play or a very long one I just want to show guys that how to kind of get through those problems and volley for positions to maybe a pricing discussion so we'll see how it goes
maybe I'm gonna embarrass myself but hey what kind of attitude should I have just a normal attitude like don't give me a hard time because I never saw the website so okay let's go for it so somehow we have the conversation we're talking like on Zoom
or a Skype or on the phone right yeah and you found me on BND's or you found me somewhere in like hey yon I really love what you do
and if this project so maybe we can start off by yeah hey Jana I love what you do I have a project that I need help with an e-commerce website how much it cost me to do that look good awesome so thanks Chris for reaching out appreciate that you love my my work basically before I can give you any sort of pricing or EVO code or talk about the process I would really love to find out kind of the why are you trying to build a website so can you talk to me before that why are you building the website right now yeah I'd be happy to but I'm new to shopping for this I've talked to a couple of people I just need to get a range of price because maybe it's not a good fit for me and I don't want to go through the whole talking about like what it's for
okay so what are you looking for in the in the new website I'm looking for improved conversion I need an overhaul refresh I feel like since we designed it originally a couple years back it's feeling super dated to me right now I need help and getting it to visual look better but and also to improve the conversions yeah so the person or the company that did that for you before you mentioned in the past are you still in touch with them or yeah they're currently doing the site but I'm ready for change so why won't you engage with them what what is maybe kind of the relationship you have with that agency that did that for you before
yeah but yah you didn't ask my question I just needed know ballpark figure here okay so I can give you kind of a range we usually go for e-commerce websites in the range anywhere from you know 20 to 50,000 it can be anywhere depending on the goal we're trying to solve so you've mentioned conversions so how much I mean currently how much better would you like your conversions to be in a given month right so I want to increase it by 1.5 percent is that possible 1.5 percent well do you know any other company in your space that have done it like this I do not I don't spend too much time thinking about other companies
okay so I can give you like a industry average because we work with a similar one I think we can get it up to 1.5 shouldn't be a problem we've done it up to two percent just for me to understand how much would that mean to your business what is 1.5 increase in revenue per month for the year come on Thea per month let's say it's a hundred thousand dollars okay so let's assume it's a hundred thousand dollars and if I extrapolate that and you know talk about an annual revenue this can be like 1.2 million dollars so that's right let's assume that's the case so how much money would you be willing to spend to fix this problem that cost you 1.2 million dollars annually I don't know I mean if we were spend money well you know with when it comes to guarantee I definitely can guarantee the results however we would definitely charge extra on top of that for guarantee when it comes to when it comes to just plain plain website revamp we don't generally stick to guarantees because you know we can't really control every aspect of your sales process and everything your company does so for a 1.2 million dollar project what do you think is a fair price to charge to charge an agency well I'm not sure but before you were saying somewhere between 20 to 40 K when you said that I was like oh that sounded like a lot but yes light up the 1.2 million it's probably not too much so yeah I mean spending somewhere between 20 to 40 K especially if you well let's say this what if I ask you guarantee me results give me a 1 give me one and a half percent conversion increase what would you have to charge me to do that I believe to do that we would be around 100 to 120 thousand and we can guarantee you that okay cuz we've done it before and okay pretty much knows the difference between that and say 40 K 4 yep
9 so it's basically like 2 to 3 times as much for guarantee
yeah okay
would you be willing to write that in a contract
yeah they're Finkley I can send it over to you and okay so what happens if you can't get me the conversion and how long do you anticipate it taking to get the numbers up to there it should take us around you know right now six months I guess six months
yeah is that pretty typical for you it's typical but I would need to know more about you know your website and stuff but I guess six months should be fine
so how do I pay you if we're not sure that you can get the results point three percent well we do basically with the sprints so we charge based on basically different how would I call the sprints pretty sure you're familiar with this so first of we charge around 30% for the entire projects upfront then after one part is delivered we charge another 30 and at the end once you see the increase will charge another 30 percent so that's kind of the way it is so the way that I see is if you're gonna break it up to three payments let's assume that I can pay you the 120k okay okay so you're talking about 40k for the first sprint 40k for the second and then 40k after you hit the results so what happens after I've spent $80,000 and you're not moving the needle for me well at that case we'll give you a refund 100% refund yeah okay all right as long as you can guarantee that so let me let me meet up with my my board and we'll talk about this but I think I'm comfortable with either approach at this point so can you write a proposal for us I want to see two options one we just pay you the flat forty and one way you can build me a guarantee and outline how that's gonna work that sounds great
I'll do that today okay fantastic
cool see you later right bye good bye so that was that was embarrassing but thank you for I got me a big guarantee I didn't know what to say because I I do have a guarantee in the place for selling marketing services but not selling websites and selling marketing is a bit different so what are you
27:28 gonna be xx yeah well you either fantastic
if I could handle a client the way you handled at 28 years old I'd be the ruler of the world right now
come on oh really
I'm not blowing smoke up your butt you did a very smooth job you apply to things that we just talked about and I assume you could either learn this by reading books or maybe watching some of our videos but you're very smooth at it I can see that you're pretty calm under pressure so if you can continue to do this I can see you doing really well in your life
well yeah I'm almost doing b2b sales every day so it's not that big of a deal but you got me with few things and I want to maybe unpack them so what about the guarantee how should I respond to that because really I've never had this experience where because sometimes in the marketing space we do refunds but if you sell website if you sell complex development project or design project how do you approach this if a client is asking for guarantee well there's a couple of things I noticed yeah let me be a little bit more critical now for your audience okay
yeah first is when you establish the value at 1.2 million dollars and then you ask them what would you spend you're leaving up to the client the clients gonna go super cheap on you what I would do is I would frame it to say like most consultants would charge you anywhere between 20 to 30 percent of the net yield the game in the first year so that would put us at two hundred and forty thousand dollars at the twenty percent mark not much like to spend so I need to give them some parameters otherwise gonna go right back and I did this on purpose I'm like well I was pretty good with the twenty to forty K so in doing that you left a lot of money on the table yeah yeah I just usually I think giving like a ballpark makes sense in this case it didn't because then we get into the real discussion I'll tell you why your bar ballpark the range was too low you should have said twenty to two hundred thousand yeah isn't that kind of like a huge spread yeah and you want to give a huge spread
yeah there's no penalty for giving a huge spread because when you do it that like whoa this guy's worked on really big projects before this is very interesting so then it will engage them in dialogue what determines the difference between the $20,000 web design and of 200 well now you can go into diagnosing tell me what is you're trying to do
see much more organic flow so when somebody asks you for the price give them a big big range and in what in in government contracts is referred to as a general order of magnitude bid which is ten dollars one hundred one thousand ten thousand one hundred thousand 1 million 1 billion where are we so I'm just gonna give you big numbers and then they'll understand the absurdity of asking for a budget prior to talking about what it is that we're doing
ya know and you could say that
just like without knowing more between 20 to 200 thousand or you can even say 2 million I've said this before on cause I've done commercials for fifty thousand dollars and a million dollars where are we at okay
just matter-of-factly so just adjust to unpick this one for people who are listening maybe mentioning price even in the beginning you can name drop it but just give it a big spread something around like hey it can be anywhere from 20 to 200 but before I talk about that I would really need to understand the project so you don't need to give them specific pricing even if they ask because you haven't been value is that kind of how you can frame this if they kind of the first question is how much is it yeah yeah you can say that without knowing more this is my best gas shot in the dark you can say it's between 20 to 200 thousand how does that feel I wouldn't even try to explain it yeah so you should try to like defend it and to talk more about it is a sign of weakness mm-hmm okay so I said between 20 to 200 thousand how does that feel then they get to respond that's absurd
yung then you're like well let's talk more about what it is that we're trying to do that's what happens when I have to bid in the dark
yeah kind of acknowledge what they said and then just move on and don't talk about it this is a conversation so in the sales do less talking
hmm
so whoever talks less wins whoever talks less whoever asks more question
questions is in control of the conversation yeah that's so true especially when you up when you asked about the guarantee I was just talking a lot there because I didn't know what to say so let's get back to it we're talking about the pricing and you're like 1.2 million dollars
and then you would say typically so it seems like this is the norm 20% of the gain in the first year and would put us at about 240,000 if my math is correct what do you want to spend
now you've anchored so high
that if they go back to 20 or $30,000 like what is wrong and then you can say what am I missing here what am I missing here so if we can't spend the appropriate amount of resources and energy are we really thinking this is going to happen okay so most entrepreneurs most decision-makers can see that Wow
if I spend two and a thousand but I'm gonna increase my sales but to 1.2 million dollars I'm still ahead by about a million dollars mm-hmm
I need something to solve this so the rest of the conversation is going to be around are you the right person to solve this problem it's not about the money yeah exactly
okay so when the question of the guarantee comes up you're going to say something like this now there are things I can control and then there are things that I cannot write and hopefully I have the wisdom to understand the difference between the two so if you would like a guarantee the stronger the guarantee the more it's going to look like 1.2 million dollars because if I can make it make that money for you then it's gonna be probably around a million dollars and I'll guarantee ironclad guarantee you don't pay us until those results happen so that's how we structure to payments at that point so what we do is we reduce the price discounted for uncertainty hmm all right so if it's a million dollars I'm gonna discount for uncertainty and say well then it'll probably be around two to three hundred thousand dollars because there's things I cannot control are they okay with this if you phrase it like this or try all you have to do is try yeah
now most people once I get to the to 20 percent in that price point we're gonna lock into a price and we're good to go
none of my clients have ever asked me for a guarantee but the reason why I say guarantee is because people will watch our show asks us all the time how can you guarantee the results that's why it's important for us to demonstrate it you can't guarantee the results you're not solving the problem you're back to being an order taker again
so what do you think this was super valuable I guess for everybody who's listening so what do you think of people who charge per hour I know you have a specific kind of mindset towards that so yeah charging for our measures effort and not results so I'll give you the analogy and it's when I came up with recently if we watch a soccer game a football game in Europe right and a football game there dribbling the ball back and forth across the field now who's the most celebrated person who's the MVP is if a person who dribbles for the longest or the person who touches it and puts it in the goal yep
that's the person no I so if if you're saying hourly pricing makes sense to you no problem keep doing that but what you're saying is I'm charging you for the effort and not the result so you can dribble the ball for 89 minutes of a 90 minute game and not do anything to change the outcome mm-hmm the other team the opponent's they steal the ball they put it in and it's game over
you've lost the game so there's too much fascination and attachment to hourly base pricing I think mostly because of the way the modern capitalist capitalistic system has been developed to measure a workers value by the time that they work on something I think it's an antiquated idea now of course if you work for somebody if you're a freelancer a temporary employee that's how you work you charge based on time I'm not talking about that I'm talking about people who take on project rates who are running a company who are trying to work with the decision makers and not just as a temporary employee there's a big difference there
yeah and so one big question that comes up now is how do you avoid the scope creep basically how can you actually have a clear specification so that you can do the guarantee and everything because we know in this industry scope is always almost wrong so how do you make sure you know you don't lose money at the end when you promise a price not based on time and material would say but based on takes fixed price based on value right
well you're you're charging you you're capturing value you're doing value-based pricing
but what you're focused on is results
mm-hmm so you need to have a clear definition of what the results are going to be now in our example here let's pretend like these were real you were you're gonna be content charging somewhere between twenty to forty K right and many people listening to this would be ecstatic if they were able to land a project for forty K but by doing the come the value conversation properly
we've gone from forty cage is somewhere in the two hundred thousand dollar range so that's a lot of room for scope creep it's more than five times the original budget you had in your mind
mmm so when you start to work on results there's a lot of room for you to mess up and try again and accommodate the client so most people have a bad reaction to scope creep because they've brokered a poor deal for themselves so when the client calls you you're annoyed you're feeling taken advantage of and disrespected almost always because you haven't been paid enough mm-hmm when you go to a really high-end hotel or a restaurant they treat you like you're the king are they unhappy is there any request that you can make that they won't tried their best to fulfill some four-star restaurants when you get up to use the bathroom the chef cooks you a new bowl of food that is service because they've built it into their cost yeah you are paying for that so that's the problem so if you feel like scope creep is bad and you don't like it it's because usually a couple things one is you've under charge two you don't have clarity on the goals you're just selling time again so when you don't get paid for that time you're not you're not happy and nor should you be but who signed up for that deal you signed up for that deal
hmm
so is it important to have this conversation with a c-level executive or can a meat manager or somebody like a marketing person who's just you know getting bids from everybody else make this decision because I can they see value as the same no no you have to work with the decision-maker somebody who has skin in the game somebody who has something
steak the reason why is when you talk to a marketing person even if the marketing director because they're still an employee they don't have skin in the game they'll say well budget for this is this whereas the executive says we don't care what it takes I'll find the money to make this work there's a big difference in mindset and their focus yeah exactly one thing I know this is a big breakthrough this was a breakthrough for me was charging for thinking and doing strategy so I'm not sure if you can touch on that just quickly but how did you when did you start charging for thinking because I know it wasn't always the case probably when was that switch and why do you think this is like the big nugget which most companies don't utilize or even like even grown-up agencies that we work with they don't do that sometimes right until you can build for the time in which you think you're not charging for it until you separate that out in my opinion it's just my opinion I'm not charging for thinking you're baking that into the making part and it's very important for me in terms of my own self validation to separate the discovery and the strategic thinking as a separate item to charge for it not now I've been in business since 1995 and four decades two decades almost I was basically in the order taker so the advertising agency would figure out strategically what's the big problem to solve how to solve it how to position it and they would write the script and then they would ask us to bid on it so really our bid was us just trying to solve the visual problem and it's at the tail end of a very long process okay yeah we after a finite amount of value doing that how do you move up in the chain how do you create more value you have to think like they think you have to acquire those skills about copywriting about marketing positioning you have to understand where the needle has moved so you have to speak like an entrepreneur and so about four-and-a-half years ago
hmm
I learned a framework that was taught to me by my friend Jose Kabbalah to build websites and I thought well this
fantastic the framework can actually be applied to any problem to help us get to the root of the issue once you started doing that I started charging for strategy it took me about a year a little less than a year from the time in which I learned it for me to get an actual client to pay me $10,000 to do the thinking part once the first job booked and it took a while took a lot of convincing here and there then the next one came and the next one came and then I changed the price from ten to thirty thousand dollars because people had so much value from it so like a lot of people say it takes a lot of effort to go from zero to the first one but a lot less effort to go from the first one to 30k I think the last time we did strategy we charged over six figures for it
just for the thinking part alone why is this important to you
despite the obvious financial gain that you're going to have
it's important to you because you are finally in a position to help your clients through a process of figuring out what the best methods are for them to achieve a particular result you get to design a solution now what it looks like per se you get to design the solution which is a very powerful thing to be at the seat of the table with a c-level executive with the decision-maker talking to you almost as a consultant confidant should we do this should we not do this that's awesome now this is not for everybody I don't mean to say this that I expect the 200,000 designers that are out there all of a sudden become strategists tomorrow that's not it
this is for the few people who can hear this who want this who desire this and have the skill set the communication style the temperament to be able to do this young you seem to be a person who can do this so for people just like you yeah we do that a lot and I even bring in a senior guy that I know to do these assessments with me and we even raise the pricing by that so it's it's super it's changed the business definitely so maybe we can move away from this topic because there's so much to talk about and just I'll quickly ask you a few questions maybe you can just give me yes or no answer
this is Colin the notorious for fire away fast because I don't have much time left I need I do need to prep got it so first question cold email is spam yes all right in ten years a I will replace sales reps and not the way I define sales rep no b2b sales rep but yeah okay got it everybody can learn to sell sales people aren't born yes and being able to sell is more important than your product or service at least as important the audit my last question would be kind of a story I'm just gonna wrap it up very quickly so you have got a check from the IRS and it's a very nasty one you owe them all the money all the revenue every house everything you own will be freezed in a week you have a friend he's a tech entrepreneur
he's not a sales guy or he doesn't have any sales background but he has this big presentation tomorrow in this enterprise company where he can close a huge deal and if you train him properly he'll give he's willing to give you a 50% Commission which will pay off your debt to the IRS you have one day to teach him everything you learned in your years of experience in b2b sales what would be your top three things to teach a person who has never been in the sales conversation in this b2b kind of environment okay so what you need to do is find a big problem to solve you need to listen to the objections that they're going to have about working with you specifically and you just need to ask really great questions
never sell listen be of service to people so the idea of sales is an outdated one where we try to razzle-dazzle people with our ability to speak about our knowledge and to use pressure points to get them to make a decision fast I believe that's a very out daily outdated definition of what a salesperson does a salesperson sales through curiosity but helping the client get clarity over the problem they're trying to solve and is a great listener and a great question ologist if you will you got it
any last book you've read that you would recommend to somebody yeah I really love I'm about halfway done reading the book this is marketing by Seth Godin it's his latest book it's dense I've reread the first half three times already and I've gotten a lot of knowledge from it the other books I'm gonna recommend people is to read the win without pitching manifesto and pricing creativity by blare ends many if not most of the concepts I've shared with you today come from reading just those two books that's amazing
all right everybody so today this was Chris make sure to check him out Chris do you want to plug anything the future anything you want to talk about you can talk about now no I did the two things I just want to say if you want more information we have a youtube channel one set at the top of the show that's almost and we're gonna hit 500 thousand subs pretty soon with over 800 videos it's called the future with no II drop the e go the future no e is here okay check us out we're on Facebook we're on Twitter Instagram we're very active especially if you follow

Crafting Value-Based Project Quotes
(Saved responses are view only)
When crafting a quote, Louis Amy Engineering should strategically present numbers to emphasize value, outcomes, and transformation for the client, while explicitly avoiding detailed internal cost breakdowns or hourly rates. Chris Do's philosophy advocates for a value-based pricing model that focuses on the client's desired future state and the impact of the services, rather than the effort involved.
Here’s a breakdown of what numbers to include and how to present them, aligned with Chris Do's insights:
1. The Core Principle: Fixed, Value-Based Investment
• What to include: A single, clear "Final Contract Price" for each option offered. This fixed fee represents the total investment for the outcome and value delivered, not the sum of hours or costs.
• How to frame it: Present this as an "Investment" that secures the client's vision and delivers specific, desirable outcomes (e.g., "Your Investment for a Legacy Home," "Delivering Unparalleled Value: [Final Contract Price]").
2. Tiered Options for Perceived Value and Anchoring
• What to include: Three distinct pricing options (e.g., Option A: Full Bespoke, Option B: Collaborative Partnership, Option C: Core Architecture Only), each with its own fixed price.
    ◦ High-Value Anchor (Option A - Full Bespoke): Position the highest-priced option first, representing the maximum possible value and transformative outcome. This sets a high initial benchmark for the client's perception of value.
    ◦ Optimal Value (Option B - Collaborative Partnership): This would be your firm's "Louis Amy Price," representing the ideal blend of expertise and value, typically slightly below the highest anchor.
    ◦ Contextual Contrast (Option C - Core Architecture Only): This is the lowest-scope, lowest-priced option, serving to make the mid- and high-tier options appear more attractive and to highlight the value of services excluded.
• How to frame it: Clearly delineate the scope and unique benefits of each option. For the lowest tier, subtly highlight the increased client responsibility or potential challenges due to the reduced scope, which implicitly encourages moving to higher-value options.
3. Strategic Comparison Points (Controlled Transparency)
• What to include:
    ◦ Market Rate: Display the "Industry Standard" or "Market Rate" as a benchmark.
    ◦ Louis Amy Price (Internal Benchmark): Include your firm's calculated "In-House Expertise" price.
• How to frame it: Use these as secondary points to validate Louis Amy Engineering's premium positioning and to demonstrate that even with superior service, your firm offers "exceptional value". The emphasis should not be on "Total Savings" as a discount, but rather on the value delivered at the "Final Contract Price" relative to these benchmarks.
4. Construction Budget Overview
• What to include:
    ◦ Total Project Budget: The estimated overall budget for the construction project.
    ◦ Budget Distribution: High-level percentages and dollar amounts allocated to major categories like "Shell Budget," "Interior Budget," and "Landscape Budget".
• How to frame it: Present this information visually (e.g., using interactive donut charts) to provide clear context for the design fees and demonstrate thoughtful financial planning. This shows the client where their total construction investment is focused.
5. Design Services Distribution (Value-Oriented)
• What to include: A breakdown of the design fee by major service categories (e.g., Scan to BIM, Building Shell, Interior, Landscape), indicating percentages and associated dollar amounts. This focuses on the different disciplines involved.
• How to frame it: This distribution should highlight the integrated nature of Louis Amy Engineering's services and how each component contributes to the holistic design and successful outcome. This is an opportunity to show the scope of professional expertise without detailing internal costs.
6. Supplemental Services (as Priced Add-ons)
• What to include: For services like specialized engineering (e.g., Geotechnical) or advanced visualization, present these as separate, fixed-fee "add-ons".
• How to frame it: Frame these as opportunities to elevate the project or mitigate further risks, linking them to specific benefits rather than just costs. Avoid "Cost + 15% Fee" language and explicit hourly tables. Instead, bundle consultant costs with Louis Amy's coordination fee into a single, value-based fixed price for the supplemental service.
Explicit Exclusions (Crucial for Value-Based Pricing)
Do NOT include the following in client-facing proposals:
• Hourly Rates: No "Hourly Fee Table" or mentions of average hourly rates. Chris Do vehemently argues that hourly billing measures effort, not value, and punishes efficiency.
• Hours Breakdowns: Remove "Project Phases & Hours Distribution" and "Fee Analysis" by hours or individual team members. This exposes internal processes and invites clients to negotiate based on time, not value.
• Internal Calculations: Do not show how a price is derived by subtracting internal costs (e.g., "Calculated as Option A minus Interiors authoring...") [Query]. This devalues services and encourages unbundling based on perceived cost, not value.
• Detailed Profit Margins: Avoid disclosing internal profit margins.
By adhering to these principles, Louis Amy Engineering can present quotes that resonate with clients by focusing on the value, outcomes, and peace of mind they are purchasing, rather than the effort or cost.
Next Step Suggestion: Review your current proposal documents and identify all instances where internal financial mechanics (like hourly rates or detailed hour breakdowns) are exposed. Prioritize their removal and replacement with value-oriented language and fixed pricing for services and add-ons.
No


where are you in your business right now the more measurable result is the easier it is for us to make it feel less abstract and then we can assign a value to it so if my goal was I want my designers to be better is that an abstract goal or is that a quantifiable goal it's super abstract what happens then is if you tell your designer I just need you to be better they're going to feel really bad they're going to be afraid they're going to lose their job and you're going to feel frustrated that they never achieved the goal because the goal is super abstract so whenever possible when you get to it you can ask your clients this result that you want how will we know when we get there how do we measure it help me out and you can do that this just takes practice okay so today I feel like we're playing basketball i taught you how to dribble how to do like a pass and how to shoot that doesn't mean you're going to be an NBA player but it does mean you know the foundational things but with enough practice with confidence you'll start to get better and better at this the video you're about to watch is a sales workshop that I had in Dubai this was just a glimpse of the full workshop on conversational selling if you want more content like this be sure you check out the link in the description so what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the sales framework okay so we know that everybody has a present a past and a future so when they come to you they're in their now state i'm right here right now i'm in front of you and some people would say there's no past there's no future just now the other stuff are imagination or memory or something like that okay so there's the now story and the now story gives us context to what's going on and what we want to do is we want to have this conversation really quickly establish like where they're at so you can ask them like where are you in your business right now just give me a little highle summary of who you serve what problems you solve shall I know I'm an architect i'm looking for a website and I hope you can solve that problem or we work with institutions designing schools or government buildings something has interrupted you to create a problem for you so if we map out on a timeline that was years ago last year this year and then today so if nothing changes everything's cool like if you're happy in your marriage no problem if you're having some friction there's some communication problems something interrupted here so what we're trying to do is find out in the timeline before we get to now something happened caused a problem something changed so that's what I refer to as the change story what we want to do is we want to find out how they're feeling this pain and the more pain they feel the more urgent they seek a solution we talked about this before right earlier today I said that there's the present there's the past and then there's the future before we can go to the future we must revisit the past which is what we're doing and help them to feel the pain if there's no pain we find a different problem or we say "I don't think there's anything I can do for you it seems like everything is okay seems like if you do nothing you'll be all right you don't need a new website you don't need a new identity design." And the funny thing is when you say that most of the time what they do is they say to you "No I really want the website identity is really important." So then they'll tell you "I don't care what you say it's still urgent i still feel that pain." Even if it's really small but if you try to convince them that it's a really big problem from a no problem they're like "No you're trying to push a sale on me." So what happens is something happened in the past i'm feeling immense pain you're helping me understand it that leads us to today okay which we got and then we're gonna say that something is standing in our way because I want something and I haven't been able to figure it out i have an obstacle but I also have a want or a need and that's going to take me to my desired future state the goal the result whatever it is hopefully it's super logical and the last one is the impact if at all possible we want to quantify to measure the result the more measurable a result is the easier it is for us to make it feel less abstract and then we can assign a value to it so if my goal was I want my designers to be better is that an abstract goal or is that a quantifiable goal it's super abstract what happens then is if you tell your designer I just need you to be better they're going to feel really bad they're going to be afraid they're going to lose their job and you're going to feel frustrated that they've never achieved the goal because the goal is super abstract so whenever possible when you get to it you can ask your clients this result that you want how will we know when we get there how do we measure it help me out and you can do that uh customer satisfaction is up turnover rate is down we have more visitors to website whatever it is it can be measured help them measure it so at this point you've pretty much got all the information that you need right tell me where you're at in your business what has changed recently that's h causing us to have this conversation today and why is this urgent why not just wait and do nothing those kinds of questions you can ask okay so what what's standing in your way then why haven't you been able to achieve this before what have you tried in the past and they'll tell you so what is it that you ultimately want i want X Y and Z and if that happens what do you get okay so if we were to play a game called the five W's the five W's is whatever you want i just keep asking you why sometimes three times sometimes four sometimes five but five is like more than enough i will show you right now here's what we're going to do we're going to do a skills practice and I'll show you how this works and I'll do it live with you tell me a little bit about what you give me context what do you do who do you do it for video editing agency we just do video editing like for YouTube social media like documents tell me like what's changed in your business what do what is it that's u the reason why we're having conversation today uh I can't generate more leads so when you say stuck how long have you been stuck six months okay you've been stuck for about 6 months what do you suspect what you need to do is an action plan for for what I need to do what I need to talk about if I need to grow my personal brand to generate more the ultimate goal is for you to double your revenue and the path forward is probably to get similar clients or clients like the ones you're already having with some kind of outreach program so that you can enhance the number of leads you have you should be able to get this and I wrote the notes okay we got it we're done and you notice how there's a lot of empty spaces because it's not that complicated he's like I want more money i want to make more money and he wants more money it's easy it's just more money if you were able just to focus purely on manufacturing and not see a loss in revenue would you consider just focusing on them see how easy that was his fear was losing revenue so if you just remove it if this happened and that happened would you then and he said do you see the change in language and body just if if is a safe space to play with our imagination low commitment and the the weird thing is momentum is a good thing so I take a little half baby step in the if but then it's like I realize it's not that scary so I can take another half step i think before you know it they've agreed so the insights to me are number one if you could have recurring revenue do you feel like you would need to generate as many leads because if the clients consistently came back to you would that generate the money that you want yeah or I don't Yeah i mean because it's much harder to get a new client than it is to keep a client so I suspect the creators who disappear something is not working in your system because I think they would want more some of them do just give up on posting so then the insight would be you have to find different creators who are just already committed already successful whereas paying you a couple thousand bucks a month is a bargain there's lots of those where would you find some of those people social media no you'd go out there it's the 1 billion summit everybody here is a freaking content creator isn't it yes they're literally right here i'm If I throw this marker I bet you'll hit a content creator be introverted right that's a new problem okay so the insight is he's scared and he's an introvert the solution for this is quite easy okay believe it or not there are tons of creators out there who want exactly what you do you should do social media editing for them and they'll pay you thousands of dollars a month they won't even think about it and just give you more work and then you run it through your system and you just do that so we found some things the creators he has are not committed they're not successful yet so if we just switch to finding successful creators we could do that that's just one insight but the real insight is focus on your manufacturing people because they pay you more and now we just need to find more of them that want more of this at a higher level and you'll do better that's what you need so if I were to present to you a plan that helped you to get more manufacturing clients outside of SEO what would that be worth to you 5k 5k I guess for recurring revenue of 10k or more a month that sounds like a little off huh if you double so you're doing 10k now and you double well let's do the math together it'd be 20k it's 70% of which Well we'll just talk about the new 10k 7k in profit a month times 12 is what 84 huh 84 84 the Asian in the room's like 84 bro 84 yeah so you're going to make $84,000 more a year and have a system that does this and you just want to spend how much is 10% good enough well I don't know would you be okay with 10% so that would be $8,400 yes okay i can tell you what i could probably come up with a plan for you for less than that would you be interested in that sure okay maybe 7,500 this is great like she was very willing to give you this information so like let's say Graham was calling Chris asking me all these questions it's a very natural thing and you're going to do this and you have the exact same problem you're going to come back and say what a jip this is just totally like this never works not it doesn't work in real life right here's the thing at any point here there could have been friction and there wasn't because it's a conversational thing that we escalated or uh scaffold towards the things that we needed to know i didn't just go into what can you spend bro what's your budget how much money do you make and that's how you guys ask that question that's the problem you haven't built trust you haven't demonstrated that you understand how businesses work so why would I give you any of that information a smart business person Mo knows that by talking to another smart business person and being clear and transparent is only going to help him and if he doesn't do that it's going to hurt him the problem is most of you fake this conversation only to find out this number and you go for the throat and they feel it too so what I'm going to tell you to do is try your best to have your conversation as naturally as possible and you'll see you'll land it somewhere close to where we landed this just takes practice okay so today I feel like we're playing um basketball i taught you how to dribble how to do like a pass and how to shoot that doesn't mean you're going to be an NBA player but it does mean you know the foundational things but with enough practice with confidence you'll start to get better and better at this you want to go deeper than this video be sure to join our patron membership here on YouTube to unlock

know you for Branding and for good reason um because you came from a design background but now have this laundry list of impressive names of um huge companies that you've done not only done creative for but also award-winning creative uh literally um so I want to talk about branding but for the sake of context for those that don't know you can you give me uh sort of the background you got into design and how did that lead you to be you know known as a branding expert and have a uh oddly successful business around it sure I'll try to make this as brief as possible feel free to pull on any of the threads whatever may interest you I am a traditionally trained graphic designer and I've worked in the commercial advertising and music video business for 25ish years before transitioning into my current role as the CEO and founder of the future so I did client work for a really long time mostly through advertising agencies we would work on some of the biggest bands and the brands in the world everything like Fortune 100 companies mostly making commercials for them as a production and post-production towards the latter part of that company which I no longer run we started doing client direct work and we we learned that there was this whole layer of agency client Strategic Management that we didn't know anything about so we had to learn all this stuff so when you're interfacing with clients directly It's usually the chief marketing officer and there's a lot that has to be done between you and them to get their their idea or their their uh marketing objective through creative through copywriting through design through all the touch points in which someone is going to come in contact with that we had to learn and we were able to level up now more recently I stopped doing client work in 2018 I am now a full-time content creator I have a team of about eight people and we just make content all day long and some of that is run branding some of it is run sales pricing negotiations and things that people may know me for that's awesome so the I I've I've dug into quite a bit of um your content at this point and moving into so said a couple things there one is full-time content creator the other is the future yes can you delineate those two things for me yes well when I when we talk about full-time content creator I am the future the future is me and we're all connected it's not a separate thing it would started out as a a kind of invitation to do something new and different from my friend Jose cabier in 2014 to make YouTube videos it's taken on its own life it's turned into a real business and so we were at Crossroads so we stopped doing client work and now we do content and so my whole team is really built around supporting the content creating educational products marketing and some public speaking stuff but we don't have any more clients we have lots of customers but no clients and so they support me I support them it's it's the business that we run I love that I think that that's a it's an important uh so no delineation between content creation and the future um they're they're hand inand uh one thing um but for most business owners there is a delineation between their business and content creation yes and they look at most business owners are kind of forced in this bucket today of I feel like I'm supposed to be producing content and it's supposed to drive leads to my business and create Roi the people that are a part of the future and follow you um do they fit in that bucket I know that you're speaking a lot of the time to agency clients and creatives um but do they fit in that bucket and how does that how do you reconcile those two things should businesses be creating content for the sake of driving leads or should they only do it if it is tied in directly to what they're already doing as a company Brad I love this question I hope you have some time because I have to unpack this uh for you and for the audience I think because I have a very strong perspective on this okay I think first we need to understand why it is that we're creating content and if we should be creating content in the first place it's my theory my belief that all companies or media companies just most of them don't know it yet and the reason why I say this is when we have a product or service has no story we would describe that as a commodity if you look at bottles of water or pairs of jeans or t-shirts it has no story attached to it it's commodity it's sold at the lowest available price and no one has a preference for it they just buy it because it's the cheapest available option the strength of your brand and your storytelling allows you to command a premium this is how we can quite literally measure the value of a brand and the example is this I don't know if they're still in business but let's say JC Penney if they put their logo on a t-shirt does the value of the T-shirt go up or does it go down and some people might argue that might actually go down I'd rather have a blank without a JC Penney logo on it so that's the value of that brand as it is applied to apparel but if I put a Nike Swoosh just a little swoosh not even the Nike words somewhere in that shirt same exact shirt does the value of that shirt go up and many would argue of course it does so we can probably buy a generic no name no label shirt for about $3 retail and then when we go to the to the Nike store when it's not discounted it's probably $24 so you could argue that the value of their brand that adding the the swo logo creates an $18 value in terms of what they can command as a premium and you can run this across the board if it's Balenciaga if it's Gucci if it's Louis Vuitton the price goes exponentially higher because that's the strength of their brand so when we come to understand this if you accept my hypothesis excuse me so if you accept my hypothesis then we have to kind of look at why people buy in the first place because clearly now it's not about the Garment anymore it's about something else and it's about status and it's about identity so when we buy something and it could be from a sorry having a little froggy throat this morning so when we buy something thing we're signaling to the other we're signaling to others what is valuable to us and what our beliefs and our taste level are so there are circles when if you hold a non- iPhone device up people look at you a little bit differently and I forget what color it is but if you send a text message back and it's not green it's like oh you're using one of those other devices aren't you so there's a little bit of that kind of snobbery that accompanies us because we want to be associated with people who believe what we believe who value what we value so to gain status to those groups that's what we need to do I heard something from pretty controversial figure Andrew Tate forget about his beliefs and his opinions whether he's guilty of crimes alleged crimes or not he said something that's quite interesting he goes I buy a Bugatti not because I like the Bugatti I could care less about the Bugatti it's a fast car it is nice but I don't care but when I drive a Bugatti people look at me differently and he gives me access to people who also own Bugattis he goes they're kind of split down the 50% of the Bugatti owners are he's like nerds that I don't care to be around I think he's talking about like Silicon Valley startup types who are very smart with finance managing money or Tech but he says the the other 50% are really interesting people have built amazing businesses have a fasinating story and in order to be in that club to have entree into that you need to have the Bugatti that's just the entry card or the entry price and it's quite interesting how he looks at the car not as the car but as access to a certain social status that allows him to have powerful networking relationships and this is true where you strip it down to whether you're a girl scout or a Boy Scout in America it says something about you if you're part of a professional speaking organization it says something about you if you have a degree if you have the PHD or a master's degree or even a bachelor's degree it says something about you so we're constantly signaling to other people what our values are and what our beliefs and accomplishments are so that we can be accepted and to accept others that's the value of the brand where do people fall into this I think there are three primary categories number one is you're a service provider or you make a product and you don't really think about brand and every time you make a piece of content you're like uh what am I doing and it's a vehicle for you to Market your products and services I think that's the lowest level of marketing or branding that we're talking about it's not very effective because everything you put out is a marketing message it's an ad and people are very smart at picking that stuff up I don't know about you or your audience but every time you're on a web page and you see all these popup banners and ads everywhere we've come we've become really good at ignoring most of it I just read the content I don't even see the ads anymore they're kind of invisible to my eye the next tier are people who are a little bit more sophisticated their business is more mature and they're realizing that they need to build a brand story around what they're doing and they're committed to making content but they're still a little bit split between I'm going to make some pieces of content but I still need to mark it it's better than the first group which is all marketing but it's not as good as the third group that I'm going to tell you about the third group realizes that the strength of my brand my storytelling how I give value to other people will benefit my business not in direct Performance Marketing ways but in terms of the overall value the talent that I can attract the business opportunities and doors that open up for me and they're committed to doing this as an expression of who they are those are the types of people I'm most excited to talk to so uh I love that and I I also think that there's I have to hit on the the Andrew Tate thing um sunk in for a second there which is it is there was a lot to unpack but as a consumer there's an interesting sense of self-awareness to say I am buying it solely for the brand value and the access and I I use the structure of self-awareness the construct there very deliberately because I think that's exactly what it is most people shy away from admitting that and don't want to say oh I'm spending two million on a car because I want to look cool or I want access to rich people um so I like the self-awareness there from a branding perspective I think it's a good lesson for business owners to look at that and think about that and know that there is a segment there that you can sell into um that has that self-awareness right and it's sort of the if you don't put the and this is uh I think this is a lesson for all businesses but if you don't put the super high ticket item there you're definitely never going to sell it and if you do almost always somebody will buy it because it positions you differently that way um yeah can I can we address this I wna I want to dig a Little Deeper if you don't mind unless you're gonna ask another question about the same thing no keep going okay cool so you said that you love the self-awareness and whether people admit it or not it's happening we buy into status way more than we are willing to acknowledge and I think that's just denial whether you're aware of it or not you're doing this all the time so I was reading I think Alex rosi's book hundred million doll offers and he goes you know it you people buy into status all the time and then he was sharing the story and then he said that some some ladies says no actually if you drove up with a ferrrari or Porsche my group you would be an outcast and he goes okay so what do you drive she goes a minivan so why do you drive a minivan because it's convenient no because to your Club to the group that matters to you the minivan is what gives you access it means I'm committed to being a good parent I'm G to schlep my kids around town I'm I'm going to be their Uber service for for a good portion of the life and I'm really involved and engaging in the the nurturing of my own children that's what signals to them so you're actually doing the same thing but it's a different vehicle quite literally so whether you're aware of this or not we're making all these kinds of decisions whether you choose to eat at this hamburger place or to to buy a a good from this department store or that department store you're making lots of decisions there's a a quote from Anna lape she could she says something to the fact that every every dollar you spend is a vote for the kind of world that you want to live in and that's a really important thing and and I think we all know this every vote that you cast says this is the government I want to be part of and every dollar you spend makes makes sure that that organization that company that business is in business tomorrow and they beat their competition because you connect more with them and so the the the expression goes the brand with the strongest tribe always wins the people are willing to go to bat for you who are willing to wait in line who are willing to tell others about you to prosze and to become an advocate for your business you will win so I I generally believe that I from a the from a outcome oriented business perspective and I think there's a lot of other social layers in there but from a business perspective of just trying to get to the outcome and grow yes the stronger tribe is going to win um if we go into the content creation side you know you built these this construct of three different types of content creators right basically all content has a CT a buy my shit next content is like it's producing some value but it still has an ask in there or something and then the third is all value driven right and if I look at likelihood of immediate well I can't even say immediate performance but the the latter one focuses on brand and building strength of brand um I think about Enterprise companies versus startups and how they allocate dollars typically historically relative to Brand building and historically brand has really been established through Enterprise and they allocate a portion of their budget to Brand building this is like billboard ads Super Bowl ads stuff where they don't expect an immediate Roi but they're doing it because they're big and they want to make sure their brand is present how do you see the necessity for brand uh and time spent towards it fitting into you know a0 to1 million company versus a 10 to 50 versus Enterprise okay I I think I can answer some of that in a broad sense because I don't spend enough time consulting or coaching companies within those individual categories so it's just observations and anecdote so yeah I want to just talk a little bit about what you're talking about is awareness marketing which is one portion of brand building and it used to be very effective pre social media pre- interet and and that's what the agency World lives in today and they they haven't quite fully figured out the modern landscape of brand building when you put out a message that then can be refuted or the the messages that we have with each other the conversations that we have with each other if it doesn't align with what you're saying then we don't buy it and we already know this because if you buy a product at least I do on Amazon I don't care what the advertising says I just read the reviews are there enough positive reviews are there enough critical reviews do these feel like real people and not just robots or people you pay to leave your review and when I go to watch a movie I look at the Rotten Tomato score I don't really care what the critics say I don't really care what the marketing machine says if has a low Rotten Tomato score which is like a Metacritic then I'm not really going to go see that movie either I need enough people to say this is worthwhile of an Endeavor for me to do it and so the conversation and the control of the brand and the brand messaging has shifted dramatically ly from the corporations to the customers so it's the the corporations no longer control the brand the customers control the brand it's a wild concept and it's one that a lot of people still don't fully understand or have not even been introduced to the concept now brand is more than just the marketing part of it it is the culture of the company the people you hire because every time that a customer interfaces or comes in contact with your company an impression is made if there are enough of these imp across multiple touch points that creates a positive feeling then you have a brand otherwise you have you have collateral damage or something else you have some other thing that you have to deal with right so if you the argument is made in delivering happiness a book by Tony Shay he goes if you go and hang out at bar and a bunch of people from Microsoft or Amazon or Netflix are hanging out there and they're total deags they're rude they're misogynistic whatever it is you go away thinking Microsoft Amazon or Netflix that's the brand it's not the D Dum that comes up on your screen because that means nothing to me so when we say we have to invest in the brand we're not talking about the media buy or the cute commercials or the viral videos that you make or the social media post because that only goes so deep you start by first taking care of your people you develop a healthy culture meaning you have to have clearly defined core values that you then hire and fire people for and then everything that you do Echoes out from that I'll give you an example right now a gentleman um messaged me this morning he say Chris I've been part of your community for seven years something it happened I didn't pay and I was kicked out and to rejoin they they wanted me to do it at this rate like what gives I'm like I will take care of that personally I will resolve this for you and he goes you know oh thank thank you you don't need to deal with it right away I'm just glad that somebody's taken care of it so today the interaction between myself and someone determines what kind of feeling or impression they have with the brand it doesn't matter how great the videos are but if behind the scenes your actual real contact point is not a positive one you don't have a very good brand so when you're at the under a million dollar Mark it's a very intimate bespoke thing that you're doing you're creating a product or service for a small group of people you should be very available and accessible and everybody that you hire should be a reflection of you and your core values so when somebody steps out you have to let them go have to say I don't feel like you're a good representative of our company you're not honoring our core values and I'm not saying you're a bad person but you're not a good person for us and you have to let them go otherwise they poison the brand it doesn't take a lot to do that Professor Eric Garrison talks about this he says do a good job a customer tells another person do a bad job that person tells 10 people so it won't take a lot for you to f up your brand so when you're in the5 to10 million range now the company has grown if it depends on what kind of business you're You're Building here but you may have now more employees it's still manageable core values can still be intact it's when you get into Enterprise level 20 million 100 million plus they're now people that are being hired that the founders don't even know exist so at that stage of game whether you've let your brand run out of control or you are not involved in it to begin with usually Consultants come in redefine what the company's about go back into the history about why the company was created in the first place what the core pillars are of the brand and the values and so that they can Ripple that across all touch points so from the product design to the packaging to customer service to the marketing to the customer reps and after care service it has to be consistent it only takes one one weak spot in that chain to break the entire chain Beyond a

industry would never consider doing that check out easypay.com bam to find out more I'm a huge advocate of uh value based hiring firing Etc um and one of the lines that I typically find myself saying in interviews is my I there's like a you know there's probably a blog post somewhere of what you're supposed to ask your interviewee when you're looking for a job probably a lot of them but I get the same questions all the time and you know one of them is to to the end of uh what's your vision what are you looking for and so when I get asked this I go down the path of you know the Future Vision for Easy Pay Direct and where we are but the other thing I bring up is I hire and Fire based on core values and kpis kpis flesh themselves out you show up to the job and you don't perform we can see that um but the value side of it the important part is that I'm not trying to get people to adopt my values when they come into the company I'm trying to find people that live in a way that is aligned with how we already behave and there's a huge difference there and then through the interview process of course I am it is your job as the person looking for a job to see if you think you're aligned I just am in a better position to do that because I know our culture very thoroughly and I interview people all day um from a a branding perspective uh you I've heard you say the point of building a personal brand is to get in touch with yourself what is the point of building a company's brand okay man you asked really hard questions and I'm sorry that when you ask a a seemingly very simple question I go on for 25 minutes because maybe saying God this guy no man you have you have very interesting approaches to things and so I'm I'm glad I'm asking you tough questions that's it's more fun this way my goodness I I just want to take a moment to acknowledge that that Brad's question is simple in its structure and ingenious in its design and that it's a it's like this key that that unlocks multiple doors and it just like he just ask a simple question bro just answer it and I can't because we have to understand one to unpack the other so in in terms I'm gonna try to thread the answer to hit multiple questions here when you build your personal brand I think people think it's like your marketing Services again and they're just getting this all wrong it's like who are you what makes you you what is the true authentic you that you're afraid that the world's going to find out and authenticity to me is a Str word that is wielded around that I'm like it you guys are making it so complicated who are you when no one's watching it's simply that who are you when no one's watching everything that you put on becomes a Persona and in and all of us do this to a degree the degree in which you do it determines how inauthentic or authentic you are so some people you and I when the cameras stop we could be talking one way and as soon as the cameras are rolling we could adopt a person our personality and the bigger the change the more people are like whoa I'm not sure which is the RO Brad and which is the RO Chris I endeavored to live such that whether the camera or the microphone's on me or not I try to be as the as as the same as possible as similar as possible okay and that's what we talk about authenticity well when you're out there talking about the things that you believe in Brett as part of your personal brand you're writing you're speaking you're creating podcasts or videos about what your beliefs are when it comes to hiring you only attract at a certain point the kinds of people who are attracted to your beliefs and values and we've done this now we've we've we've been making content long enough such that when when people are looking for a job I don't want people looking for a job I want people who want to help us build our vision the mission and they believe it in their core values like they're fans before they become employees they're consumers before they become employees and I love this relationship that we we get to have and I say this and I realize that there's some privilege that comes with this because lots of companies don't produce any content they're like well how do we do that well that's part of the problem now to answer your question about like what is the purpose of branding for a company it's there's a multitude of things but it's not that different than branding for a person in that once you get to a certain level whether you're enterpris or not and the level which you get to is the point in which no one knows what you stand for anymore they've lost touch or maybe it was never defined in the first place because you've never had that dialogue you saw a need in the market you thought of a way to make the world a little bit better or a lot better and you work on that mission and that vision and you build that and you don't even talk about it because you're just you know hands in in the work and just trying to make things work and then the market responds and you grow your company and at some point people are like what is our mission is it to make more money or is it to improve the world or what is what's the problem and this is usually where we have to get back in touch with the founder story and so in both cases I say branding isn't an Act of Creation it's an act of remembering so remembering who you are as the the four or five year old with with full of dreams and passions before the world told you you couldn't do certain things we have to get in touch with that and it's an act of remembering when why did the founders why did Mary find this found this company what was she trying to solve what motivated her was it to honor her grandmother's recipe for pasta was it to build a an inclusive tech company because she herself faced discrimination what was it about and we get into that and we try to tell that story so that everybody is dancing to the same beat I think that's the purpose so the first off the content first approach is is what jumps out loudly um some of the benefits of having a strong content approach you highlighted but one of them is attracting the right people right if you have there you have no hope of having raving fans that you can hire if you're not putting out a strong message and I I like the jump off point for our conversation being that you are a full-time content creator and that's the lens that you look at it through yeah there's a business on the back end that's super important and a community that's super important that you're serving but your job is to create content and tell stories um I think that's great uh one of the the questions that I have here as the world has shifted seemingly or put more of an emphasis on the importance of personal brand is should all brands have have a face attached to them so you've got you know Tesla and all of elon's companies Elon has a very strong personal brand in you know have whatever opinion you want of him as a human um and there are lots of other companies that also have a very strong face then there are companies that exist without a strong face without a personal brand tied to them what's your opinion do you need one is there uh a positive negative one way or the other very good question I I am reluctant to say all because I've not consider all companies and positions and I don't think all companies need to have a face but they need to be known for something and oftentimes like say Starbucks do you know who the founder of Starbucks is I do but only because I'm you know a business GE because you're a nerd and you know about these things and and and remind me his name because I'm spacing on his name right now Howard Howard Howard Schultz right Schultz yep yes so Howard Schultz founded Starbucks in Seattle and and was able to grow this company into a global monster and Howard's face is not in the Starbucks cup Howard's story is not preent in everything that they do because it doesn't benefit the company to talk about that there's no point but there is this idea that they wanted to create this European like coffee experience and they move the culture that's a powerful thing they they trained Americans to crave a four or five dollar cup of coffee and to have this little experience based on I think if The Story Goes based on his experience was traveling abroad and saying I love this part about European culture that they celebrate coffee as an art form and and we can Elevate the taste buds because before then I think it was drip coffee and folders instant and he changed the culture which is a very powerful thing for a person to be able to do so he tapped into an emerging Trend was able to create this but Starbucks that's not what the brand is about but they have a very powerful brand whereas say um Kentucky Fried Chicken or KFC for the longest time I thought that Colonel Sanders is a mascot like Ronald McDonald's not a real person right but it turns out Harland Sanders is a real person who started a business in his 70s and it was just it's part of his legacy story right it's amazing story but for the most part in the 80s and the 90s and even earlys that story was not told at all no it was like a mascot like Burger King is not a real person Ronald McDonald's not a real person Wendy's is K Colonel Sanders is a real person so it really depends now I think here's the the interesting thing that's happened in the last I would say 10 to 15 years is that because of the availability of social media for companies to reach out to Consumers directly with without a big media buyer or an agency involved or network the conversation has changed a lot so I think strategies emerg because of constraints when there were three major networks to advertise on we knew what we were getting into and those were the only options so that would work but now there are so many different options when you don't have a strong brand or Brand Story or person or face behind the brand you pay for it you pay for it in advertising and marketing I think somebody told this I don't know if it's true that Tesla spends Z in marketing it's never an ad and I'm I'm thinking like is it true and it is true yeah I think it's not anymore but it was for a long time and even now it's like a very very tiny you know they've got a magazine ad or a billboard here or there but I think that's uh that's historically ACC never seen a single Tesla ad before yeah just recently it's been like a but it's still I mean it's like a nothing percentage but you know what they did differently than almost all other brands of their scale is they had a fucking affiliate program which is crazy like major Automotive companies don't have affiliate programs and Tesla had a hey refer a friend and get a thousand bucks or get lifetime charging for free like wild but your your your point Sorry derailed your point which is still powerful right which is the BR if you think about okay so when I was in In the Heat of advertising the early 2000s I found a shocking statistic that said that American Express spends half a billion dollars in media by Al loone every single year half a billion so here comes Elon and Elon is one of the uh or Tesla is one of the few companies where creators are anxiously reporting on every little morsel every little rumor and doing all the marketing for them there are literally multiple channels on YouTube that drop daily content about what's happening with Tesla and they're eagerly anticipating the next drop the same thing is true about Apple and also with some of the AI companies like open AI here's what's coming down the line here's what we've seen what will they announce next and you need to know these things and there's this fervor this appetite for Content we want to know what happens next therefore it gives rise to the creators who tell us what's going to happen and they're Wild predictions and so if you have a strong face and person then the marketing budget becomes much much smaller and there's mystery and there's a lure and anytime they want to do something they literally hold a press conference they do a keynote presentation or something like that Apple does this and then the media come to them and they're happy to amplify the message across the social channels and I think they're all evolving and changing whether you're saying Tesla is now taking out some advertising I understand now Apple's also working with some influencers and they're not just going to say like you know we're going to stay on our high and mighty perch and and say we're above all this they can actually work with people to amplify the message and I love this idea that there's this affiliate referral program from from Elon and he's doing things so differently I love this because instead of spending thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in media bu he's like who best to sell our cars than the people who are who are already owners they convert their friends now I listened to this talk by Seth Goden he says what you want to do is you want to create a company or products such that each person is incentivized on an individual basis not monetarily to get more of their friends to join it he goes like what do you think the first person who had a fax machine did they told their friends go buy a fax machine I mean literally because the product becomes more useful and valuable if more people adopt it so you and I if we own a Tesla we're like well we need to tell four more friends because the more people that drive Teslas the more charging stations there will be in the neighborhoods in which we live in it behooves us to do this and the more support services that we have and the more dealerships we'll have and the more service centers we don't want it to be a niche product but we can't say that's true with many products right you can't and I think that there are you know the the first example the fax machine and the network of fact um I think there are lots of products like that Tesla is in a unique class like apple is where the network effects perhaps uh were a driver Tesla obviously put a number behind it and said hey we're going to pay you to do this but both of them are so product forward that they are focused on the product in the experience being badass right like it is they just and and honestly Apple paved the way for this apple was the first company in in my lifetime right I'm 43 but nobody nobody made packaging like apple until tell apple and now nobody still makes packaging like apple by the way well that's true but a lot of people try now yeah right now there's tons of companies out there that make unique boxes for you and nobody would spend money on that shit previously but Apple showed people that that was a part of the client experience the consumer experience and part of their brand and sure shit you know you talk about free advertising the unboxing videos alone on platforms like YouTube of course the packaging matters in those in the presentation of opening it up and looking at it yeah so I think the thing about Apple that still connects itself to Steve Jobs is this idea of insanely great so people think like the the Apple slogan is really think different but I think it's insanely great it's something that he would start to say and I think it captures his personal brand and Apple's DNA in two words and that's why I'm a big proponent for this two work brand thing as as you may know Steve Jobs is not an easy person to work with and his attention to detail is legendary almost maniacal that he literally would fly to Italy and pick the slabs of marble that were going to go into the Apple Stores to then running this multi-billion dollar Corporation no detail was was too small for him to get his in which has its own kind of like negative effect and I understand even on his deathbed uh he was reviewing copy for ads from from shy day from Lee clout which is ridiculous to me so his attention to detail and there's a rumor that said something like when they were announcing their new laser printer or something and they connected it for Steve and he's like why doesn't it work with my computer it should already know this is ridiculous go fix it before we launch and it's that kind of stuff that is like I have extremely high standards and we will not let go of anything he got mad at his team uh that was running the Apple Store because when he went to Apple Store the products did not look like they do in the commercials so you had them change all the lighting in the store so that it would look like the way they do in the commercials what he doesn't realize being a a CEO of a multi-billion trillion dollar company is the photos that you see and the videos that you see are highly manipulated with like 85 different lights and composite it together to make this single image look great I know this because I have friends who shoot for apple and so he's like trying to recreate this experience in the store and the demand to do that despite the impossibility of it the feasibility it didn't matter to him so that was the insane part the great part is when you train your entire team to think and work that there's no detail that's too small you can achieve great greatness right so insanely great is what drives Apple so think about the packaging like you know what packaging is pretty much like a thing you have to do not a thing you get to enjoy and then they consult origami experts they look at the friction of the box and making a satisfying sound the way it inter wraps itself and now that kind of the shrink wrap that drives people insane you pull in one tab the whole thing falls apart until then it's solid and so now they've given something an experience to me that I find to be delightful so a lot of people buy Apple products don't throw away the boxes because number of apple boxes I have in my closet is ridiculous what are we gonna do with it BR why do we save all the boxes I don't know man but I've got probably got like six that are tucked away in my closet at least six and they're displayed on my sun shelf like a prize like a trophy and we don't know what we're going to do with them because when we are ready with our devices we're ready to give them to someone else very rarely are we repackaging them up in the original packaging but I think what they've done is they've made such Exquisite packaging that we feel horrible to throw it away yeah yeah it's sort of like throwing away somebody's book you know it's this we're in an era where so many people write books publish books self-publish or otherwise and get them out and they use it as a marketing um it's like a business card right but it's it's a piece of marketing material because nobody throws away somebody's book whether you're going to read it or not or even have an intention of it it's not going in the trash um and maybe the book is more useful than a box but there's a similar similar approach and mentality there for sure yeah um I like you know one of the things that you said that I think is a really big takeaway is this idea of setting a standard that is impossible but whether it's impossible or not having the standard is what drives people towards excellence and even if they never hit the mark of Perfection they're driving in that direction and it creates a different culture community and set of values than if you don't set that really high standard um have you read the the newest Elon Musk book The Walter Isaacson version no so great book um but one of the recurring themes is Elon I can't remember the exact language he uses but it's something along the lines of irrationally urgent and it's like it's like a core value for elon's companies that the everybody does things and they're on the same page that we have irrational urgency and again it's one of these Notions of even when you use that language you realize that this is not rational but we're all on the same page that we're doing this shit now right and when we find a problem we are fixing it now you know does it have to be done tomorrow well in this culture sure it does and whether that's irrational or not that sense of urgency allows them to drive Innovation quicker and so I love that framework of yeah set the bar up there put the highest pric product make the standard impossibly great and then see what the company does to follow and see what kind of culture you create in doing that yeah I think that Mantra I hope that's the Mantra because I like it a lot it's a very much a Silicon Valley thing where uh was it Facebook that it says move fast break things or something like that so it's this idea that everyone is out to destroy us we need to pretend like tomorrow doesn't exist and we fight for each and every day but if you tie that into the larger narrative one that I think Elon mastered um years ago when when he was talking about Tesla and why are we doing what we're doing I remember the press conference quite vividly in my mind because my wife had a very different reaction one that I was like oh this is really interesting he's done something so Elon goes on stage and he goes and it's he's a very awkward presenter in the way he says things right I think he his as or whatever right yeah and and some people think it's an act I'm like I don't think it's an act I just think we we we're not used to seeing someone behave and talk this way especially someone who runs such a big powerful company he goes on stage he's talking about something about the next car and he goes wait wait um I'm off track I need to talk about what's important he goes okay we we we released the the Roadster so that we can then make a more mass consumer product friendly vehicle to Model S and we're glad that you bought that so that you can bu so that we can make an even more affordable car in the three or whatever and we're working towards that and that's where he was in the story and he goes well why does any of this matter anyways because he says climate change is the biggest existential threat that we have to humanity we cannot wait he goes that people think that this is a talk and and we can't do anything about it and he goes well I've done the calculations he goes this is how many square miles of solar panels we need to feed the entire grid of the United States it goes it sounds like a lot but relative to the the land mass that we have it's a tiny fraction of one state and all the technology is available it's all possible and where will we put it where it's where we get a lot of sunshine and we're not prone to earthquakes or things he goes here's he's explaining his whole thing so then he he then concludes that part of the talk by saying I want to thank you because every car you buy allows us to do this the next thing and the next thing and then we can we can rapidly deploy this thing because we cannot wait some scientists say that you know whether you're a climate denier or an evangelist doesn't matter some scientists say we're almost past a Tipping Point where it's irreversible so this idea of irrationally urgent it's like we may not have all the data but we need to act as if because if we're wrong we're okay but if we're right and we don't do something about it we're afed and so my wife said I'm all in and this the first time she's ever responded to any car company in the world I'm in I bought into div Vision well I think that for for me I think it's it's incredibly uncommon for an entrepreneur to have such a grand vision and Elon is one of one no question about it um in in fact his master plan is literally on his site as the master plan and it is laid out exactly what he's doing what order how and then there's the master plan part do and I mean he's he's a very interesting character but I think that one of the takeaways is um you don't need to have this Grand Vision or plan to set set a bar that is high that you can pursue that will inspire other people to follow you um and you don't have to have the concrete path to get there to get inspiration to flow through your organization or your clients but you do need to set the bar and set the standard if you expect anybody to do that in the first place that's right I think Simon Sy said something about this like not everybody has to have a Grand Vision or Mission we we'll join other people's mission and vision we can support that so tell me from a as a full-time content creator tell me how tell me the elements of strong content and how some of this fits into how you think about creating content okay um just keep in mind that all strategies autobiographical and that what I'm about to say is work for me may not work for you and there's lots of bias and and affirmations in terms of like what it is I do I believe the best content creators yeah little disclaimer the best content creators the best brand builders are the best Educators they go hand inand if we think about what we're trying to do is we're trying to improve the lives of people whether it be about Transportation about being aware of the the footprint the carbon footprint that you're leaving the world or just trying to improve your business so that you can have a rainy day fund so that you can take your partner on a vacation or support an elderly parent doesn't really matter so in order to transform people's lives we we must be the most effective Educators that we can be so if you're out there prosti products and services as a means to get people in your funnel and to extract value from them I think you're approaching it from the wrong point of view you should be thinking about how do I put money in your pocket such that your pockets are so full the change that falls out of it is something that you willing to reciprocate back to us so that we can to do this so that you're making an active decision to vote for the kind of world that you want to live in but we start with the premise give value to a point in which a person starts to feel guilty and then they'll go turn around they'll become a sustaining member they'll join your coaching Community they'll buy product that they don't need or they'll gift it to their friends because they they're such an uh they've been so transformed and they've been moved emotionally to do so and we do this in a way that I I think feels conr with my values and I'm not saying I'm not out there pitching I am there I'm not saying there's zero call to action there are there has to be because at times people just don't know what to do and you need to give them the opportunity to say I'd like to give back thank you for allowing me to do this and I've been really shy about this before I'm not so shy about it anymore if you so let's go with the call call the action theme Here If you're looking at um let's let's use a a use case let's say you've got a and you can use yourself if you want here let's just start there um what's the breakdown if you're putting out x amount of content what percentage of it has a CTA in it and how do you decide yes I'm working on something new right now and I I want to just put this out there and I'm not 100% committed to it yet so this is a fairly new idea I'm trying out if your social feeds have just basically is on life support like no one engag is no one shares no one talks and you're just creating work and you're feeling really burnt out about it because you're not getting any return I I say that we need to act quickly before the body goes cold and so we we're going to call 911 and we're going to do some CPR on your content the 911 formula is nine pieces of value ask for nothing educate purely demonstrate what it is that you do help people one piece of content that's really personal something about you about what you do show them a behind scenes moment so they know there's a real person behind it because all education it then it starts to feel really distant like I don't where's Colonel Sanders again like wait Steve who Elon what so we find that mix and I I think that a lot of people lean in on the education part and then they get no traction because it's like well who the hell are you I don't know anything about you your life your story about your perspective about your experience and I want to connect with the human behind it so nine pieces of value one personal thing that has nothing to do with anything except for you know what this is my life I'm going to turn the camera around and I'm going to show you what it looks like just for a moment and the last one is a call to action so that one is one where you give a full-throated pitch on whatever it is that you want and you can do this without trying to mask it as a piece of content or value you can just say literally I have a new program that I'm launching I'd love to have you in it thanks for considering it and now back to the original to the regular program content so nine pieces of value education based or inspiration one BTS behind the scenes and then one strong call to action so that you can make money so you keep doing this that's awesome um I see some to I first of all I am a huge fan of uh I think everybody needs con concrete structure I think everybody is served by concrete structure I should say um and so I love love the framework the other is anytime time this wasn't an acronym but it was the same sort of device where you latched on to 911 which I think is awesome um super memorable uh in terms of the nine pieces of content that uh add value um the thing that jumped out to me is sort of the variations that I see of that currently and some of it is teaching the value is teaching and some of it the value is entertainment and I think that that you know some humans um are better fit for one versus the other um from a personal brand perspective uh that all makes sense to me hey my character is capable of doing you know I am just a funny person right or I want to be on stage or look at me or whatever right um from a a company's brand perspective I I I immediately think you know like we sell credit card processing in merchant accounts it is a fundamentally dry Topic in subject matter um it's also super important because businesses if they can't accept payments they've got a big problem um in in the scheme of something like that when you think about education or entertainment uh let's take that brand where do you think those nine pieces of content should fit what type of stuff and obviously you don't know our space right but you think it should be all educating around it do you think that you should with drier Brands you should focus more on uh entertainment or humor or other types of content in those nine um how does that strike you okay good question I I think it requires a couple different things some variables to be ironed out before I can make a recommendation number one is who's the ideal client Avatar we focus on the minimal viable audience and we kind of understand who they are and when I say that to people like well it's Entre R preneurs and like that's not a minimum viable audience if you can't see them and and and the test is if you can't predict where they eat what channels they watch what books they're reading what movies they enjoy and where they'll be next then you you've got no Avatar so we kind of have to reduce it down to your ideal client Avatar and once you have that then you can make some predictions about what are their hopes and dreams what what is the pain point that they have and there's an exercise that I do in my brand strategy Workshop where we say or okay what are all the jobs to be done for that this person has to deal with on a daily basis make breakfast drop the kids off at school or check in on Johnny's homework and then answer 55 emails and then write a report just go down the list and then see where all the gaps are so what are the gaps connected to each one of those tasks so the jobs get done so preparing breakfast well what is the obstacle what's the Gap there well uh there's not a lot of time uh we're we you know what's in the fridge isn't always like what I want to cook and providing good healthy meals for my children so you just write down as many gaps as you can think of okay so you attach each job with a gap and then you ask yourself what is the opportunity what if anything can we do in our line of work that would make their lives a little bit easier and some of them we have no answers to but we try to answer them as best as we can and if it's a resource that we can provide to people have nothing to do with us even better because it's very altruistic so in the case case of of your business the one other thing we have to identify is who are you what is your what is your proclivity are you more like a straight button-up guy do you want to do humor do you sing opera do you write music and we we bring that into the mix because otherwise it's just a generic person we take your avatar we take your personality and we add into it your gifts whatever your creator gave to you as a human being now I can't tell how tall you are but you look kind of tall to me you have a longer neck I feel like people with longer necks can sing they have a a larger instrument you know I don't know if that's case can you sing I I don't think that that's a I don't think there's a causal relationship there all right okay I I just say that I don't know whatever it is you know maybe you can catch me rapping sometime but I don't know well I just made the Assumption you got the Mohawk you know you got a Vibe going on that maybe there's some some punk rock thing going on there okay whatever it is that is your gift you take that and you try put those two together and because the reason why we need to do that is because we live in a time that we're overcommunication to and we're drowning in information but people are still hungry for information and why is that and the idea that you can actually say or do something new it's a dumb idea but what we can do is we can take the information we can package the way that we see the world through our lived experiences through our personality through our very specific lens and utilize the gifts that we have to communicate that piece of information such that it becomes different than the way other people would communicate that same piece of information that's what people show up for yeah there were uh I think one of the things that hit me right away when you were talking about that was first off know your avatar U but second uh when you look at the content that you're creating that could add value to your Avatar's life um you immediately went to how they live and through through their day what are the problems that they run into through the day and what are the experiences that they go through through the day and so the content that might add value to them isn't necessarily just educating about your product and how it adds value to their business life um through the lens of your product but it could just be content that speaks to that Avatar period right it's hey we know you know if you know that your Avatar like in our case were um obviously uh not everybody fits in the bucket but you look at the ideal client profile they're doing at least a million a year that's probably a 25 to 40 year old man um and it's card not present which means that they're probably Tech focused they're they're better online than others we can make assumptions about where how they spend their days right and so we can push content around those things um I think that that's a those are those are awesome take aways for people have you built the user profile of your ideal client Avatar before have you ever gone through that exercise yes yeah we we have a few different ones that we target for different things um and but I think that you know one of the things back to kind of structur and framework I think that it's the type of exercise that is fun to go through and sometimes eye openening to go through a different time through somebody else's framework because uh you know it's sort of the no of you can read the same book 10 different times at 10 different points in your life and it'll be a different book each time yeah you have new information right yeah you as a human the book hasn't you've changed you got it and the same thing is true of companies right you go through the life cycle of a company and years later you look at it and even if the change isn't radical little tiny one degree shifts put you in a new place a year from now five years from now 10 years from now yeah you don't know this about me Brad but I used to teach sequential design at Art Center for about 15 years and it's with a bunch of creative folks and so one of the things we get people to do is to act in their mind as the characters in the story so that they can create a world it's World building right and it's an exercise that we do and then it it has real world implications into unlocking creativity so I say like whenever we draw a storyboard right what what did you just say I said I'm gonna make my staff do that okay so when we ask people uh when we look at their storyboard sequence it's it's very predictable as to what their first take on it's going to be it's going to be shockingly not surprising that the point of view is almost always from the person that's exactly the same height as they are and often times the same gender as they are but when we're talking about creating a title sequence for a serial killer well hopefully you're not a serial killer so how do you get in their mind what are they doing we have to kind of leave our lens and we have to adopt this thing and I I consider it like a like that um that classic movie It's called Manhunter I don't know if you're old enough to see that but he's a know the name criminal profiler right so the beginning of the story and this I promise make sense in a bit so he's retired and there was a crime in this person's house and it it feels like it's a serial killer and they call him and he's like no I don't want to do this he goes we need you he goes you know what happened last time so there's this question like what happened last time so he profiles criminals so well that he starts to see the world through their eyes and he gets all messed up himself he's that immersed in the profiling and I think that's what we need to do for a little bit without becoming a serial killer so I I asked them if you were to tell the story from the point of view of a toddler who's yet to walk what does this scene look like and we have them redraw it and they're seeing the bottoms of tables they're noticing chunks of gum or they're playing with something on the floor like a tear in the carpet and it's a very different lens and perspective I said now what happens if you're a fly like literally a little fly flying around and you're looking at the exact same sequence well how would that look like to you well probably wide angle lens right and being able to see everything with a field of view that we're not used to because I believe flies can see almost 360 because of the way their eyes are oriented and the lens and we're probably seeing it from a place at an angle in which it sometimes High sometimes it's low we can literally fly through a little Loop and what that would create in sensation we can we can swing around a plant and frame the shot that way so we start to look at the world in a different way when we talk about building client avatars we need to do the same thing we have to forget where Brad or Chris or Mary or Jenny what to say forget about that this is not about us it's about them let's inhabit their mind their world and their space what what what color pants are they wearing do they wear pants or is it only a dress or a skirt or leggings or joggers or whatever it is are they wearing shoes we we try to do this and we build really deep psychological profiles of the person so much so that we can draw them we know where they shop we know what brands they like we call it brand affini it's like what what brands are they most connected to we can understand or make an educated guess about where they went to school what they majored in if they finished their degree or not and when you have that deep a psychological profile your avatar is going to be really really good and this is a creative exercise and figuring out there are new products and services that we could create that could triple our Revenue this year or the content that we create will be much more hard-hitting or the engagement will go through the roof and that's what we're trying to do so starting with a really good deep customer Avatar is the starting point now good news is with the advancements in AI you don't necessarily have to call Brand strategist and spend a full day workshop doing this you can literally prompt it to because it knows create a buyer Persona or customer Avatar and you describe your business and you can say I'm running a credit card processing thing my revenue is this it's remote based I'm targeting customers who do a million dollars a year in revenue or Tech Focus that build me the ideal client Avatar tell me the demographics as well as the psycho graphics and then format that as a table it'll just do it for you and then once it does it for you you can check with yourself like does that sound like our Avatar or not if it's not that means you need to give it better data and it'll do it again but sometimes and I've done this many times you read them like my God that is spoton yeah I've done a test done this test and it's worthwhile to share with you I was doing a workshop in London I asked it to identify the top three most likely people to be at the workshop what their pain points and challenges are what the hopes and dreams where they struggle in their business how much income they have and it gave me three different profiles so I went to London I said hey I'd like to just take a poll to see if I'm work kind of an experiment right now how many of you identifies this this this the room was split in third to the te each one of the three profiles wild wild well so so I want to dig into that uh specifically and I'll I'll also I I I want to highlight a couple things one is the depth of the Avatar and how much that impacts uh potentially everything in your company how you speak to them what your advertising looks like what kind of content you create what your sales scripts are like um how you behave in general um can be in better alignment if you have a better grasp on not just the external Avatar but sort of the psychographics right who they are inside how they think how they behave what they do where their time goes um that's a really uh valuable takeaway the other is that you are likely to have multiple avatars in your company and so like for us I brought up you know the people doing a million a year well we have a huge chunk of clients that are doing much less than that right that are on on the come up on the upswing um but we don't spend advertising dollars towards them so that Avatar of a brand new entrepreneur a solopreneur that's trying to get things done how we build what we do with that information is going to be different right the outputs are going to be different and it tells a different story internally of how we need to interact with them um so I think it's a really good exercise uh all the way across the board that adds a lot of value um you brought up AI uh it is 2024 I think we're in sort of like the the initial beginning seasons of crazy ridiculous change but it's the first time ever where we've got a really functional uh robot to talk to which is now now there are a bunch of them right these initial big models language based models how do you see AI impacting marketing agencies at large I I think uh I I sometimes watch channels on Discovery about futurists talking about their predictions and and they ask them and almost always they say something very similar which is what's the biggest challenge of being a futurist and the answer is something like to not be limited by my human imagination that everything I think can be done will be done faster and on a on an exponential scale better than I think and so when you're asking me the longer theot timeline for prediction the crazier I have to be in terms of predicting what's going to happen because humans tend to look at linear progression and say well it'll be twice as good every two years and so by 8 years it' be 16 times as good know it to be 64 times as good it's not even the same kind of league so how will the the world of marketing changed because of AI I think it's already changing right now not that long ago you would literally need someone who's schooled in facilitating a brand Discovery building avatars for you would take sometimes multiple days it could take months depending on the size of organization you could spend tens of thousands into millions of dollars doing this and then you arrive at a conclusion and then you have to test it and you and then you start to ideate on products so what it's done is it's compressed this entire cycle from from months to to like minutes which is freaking crazy you can ask it to generate copy ideas for you to build sample products and say you can ask it to do things like if Disney were running my company what would they do and you can generate ideas and brainstorm with potentially the smartest person you've ever talked to and if you are good at prompting and making sure that the logic flows and you instruct it not to make up data and not to hallucinate and you tell it to do those things and and stick to data or things that can be cited and verified you get some really amazing results and so we see that may there there can be massive job displacement but we also see a 10 person agency being able to do the work of 150 people like a a 15x in productivity if the organization is Nimble if there are of like-minded people who Embrace and drive change and they understand how to work with the data part and the communication aspect so all of a sudden skills that I think weren't super valuable in the marketplace are going to become very valuable fields of study in Humanities like philosophy sociology human behavior cognitive Sciences communication critical thinking rhetoric art history just history in general so that you can make references to things that the computer already knows but you don't know I think those skills are become much more valuable so the hiring of people to staff up in these marketing firms probably will change if they're smart having a person who studied eight or 10 years of copywriting you may need one person like that but you don't need a whole team of people like that because that person can work with a different type of team to ensure that the copy is of a certain tone and there's Artistry in it but it doesn't need to be done by one person it could be done in concert with people who don't have the exact same skill set but can leverage the intelligence of the machine to do this at scale what do you think the biggest mistake somebody can make with AI in marketing today okay biggest mistake is to believe that it will just do the work for you that you don't have to do anything and that's what a lot of people do the initial re action I get for most of the people who try Ai and who aren't happy with the results who dismiss it is because they actually gave it really bad prompts they didn't understand how to give direction to people and this would exist with humano human relationships it's just being done with a computer so the computer doesn't know enough to ask you yet it probably will very soon so if you told one of your team members to go out and make a marketing campaign and that's all you gave it or that person all the direction what do you what do you anticipate as the result of this it's probably going to be pretty bad you didn't tell it for what audience what the kpi was what initiative that you're you're wanting to launch you didn't give any parameters for what success looks like and you didn't give that person permission to ask you questions ask clarifying questions before they they gave you an answer and I've done this experiment many years ago pre AI I said to my class of like eager design students they said hey everybody I want you go outside and and come back with a leaf because we're going to draw a leaf today and they all just left I'm like wait wait wait wait did anybody ever stop to ask me what kind of leaf I want what if I told you it had to be a Canadian maple leaf you'd be out there for a long time before you came back maybe days but you're so eager to take action that you haven't stopped to think what is the request that's being made of me am I capable of doing it and what parameters exists for Success you didn't bother to ask questions so we need to be much more inquisitive before we got there so marketing directors think oh just have um Jimmy and Mary go make stuff well they'll make stuff you'll get that but you won't get something that's good so I know that people have varying degrees of success some bordering on brilliant to some are like yeah that's pretty bad AI isn't it and so what AI won't do currently is it won't give you what you don't know what to ask for so when you learn how to ask the right way it will give you exactly that so it's a it's a learning curve there so quality in quality out crap in crap out yeah I think that for me my general take on it at this moment you know mid 2024 is it's a tool to interact with not somebody to delicate an outcome to yeah what uh what is the biggest mistake you think you've made in building the future I think we're going through right now I think the biggest mistake that we've made is that information and the premium we put on information is racing towards zero there's a lot of people who say information is worthless at this point and I was talking to one of my friends who was an educator at a university and she pointed out something I thought was pretty pretty insightful she said universities used to be the source of information that's where you went to learn it wasn't available anywhere and now information is available everywhere yet universities are still able to command a premium for what they do especially the good ones and it's become we're the curators of information now so there are 3,000 that you can read in marketing here's the three and we're going to have a deep discussion about it so we've read the the thousand and we've decided these are the three you need to read and we'll help you go through it so that you can extract maximum value from it so the mistake that we're making right now is we make information products as a way to make a living but information is available everywhere and we're actually contributing to our own demise in that we produce ungated content that is what we should be charging money for and so so when people can't keep up with the kind of content we're producing I think it's impacting them and their ability to say well I can't follow the stuff you give away for free and I enjoy it why would I buy a course from you when I know I can't even do that is it going to expon exponentially change my life such that I'm willing to give you my hard earned money so we're we're struggling with this right now because our friends who are in the information product space are all having challenges around selling cly information interesting uh okay so God is a designer Type ampersand icon but not really how many fucking hats do you have you are paying attention Brad how many fucking hats do you have I like the icon hat the icon hat with it uh crossed off is fantastic yeah I love it though it did take it took me a while to figure out what was going on and now in this particular lighting I can see it a little bit better but yeah uh how do you think about those hats playing into your personal brand great question you know for a long time I didn't wear a hat and I just thought I didn't look good in them it's not because of any other reason and I was at one of my students wedding and there was this it a Filipino guy and there was a guy walking around that just had the coolest style turned out he was the DJ and he was wearing a flat brim cap and when I saw him wear I'm like that's how you wear a cap so I started wearing a cap for functional reasons but then it became branding reasons functionally it's because I'm bald and have a shiny head I don't have dry skin so when the light hits it it's like a chrome ball and the story I always tell people it's like my team is very politely dancing around this subject that it's too shiny so they're flagging off flights they're adjusting things so it just doesn't become like a like a burned in white spot on my head and I see them moving things about I'm like guys what's the problem why aren't we recording yet they're like um we're just suggesting like standby I said would it be better for you guys if I wore a hat they're like uh yes please thank you then they moved all the lights back and everything was cool again I just went out in my room grabbed a hat put it on and then one of the things that happens is when you do something consistently it becomes part of your brand so be careful what it is that you do because what I want to do is when you see me for a minute absolutely when you see me for a second whether it's on a stories or reals I want you to quickly know that it's me not just from my voice not just from my glasses but every part of it needs to be me and I wanted to carry that into the real world because I'm an introvert I don't I enjoy talking to people but I don't how to begin conversations with people so now that I appear a certain way on camera I need to appear exactly the same way in in person so that somebody down the street or at a conference will say hey Chris we saw you from across the iway and that's really critical for me from a branding recog recognition point of view and and there's a phrase that I'm liking a lot now it's better to be weird or different than it is to be better people focus too much on being better but it's better to be different and different is just another word to say weird so anything that makes you a little bit a deviation from the norm helps you to stand out so initially the cap that I wore was from a brand I love it's called gar and it say raw and when we're doing live streams which is usually where people would see me like I'm coming in hot I'm gonna say what I'm goingon to say I have a strong opinion and you might feel raw about it afterwards and so people are like great except for when we see you Chris it says war and not raw because it's flipped in the mirror I'm like okay I'm not promoting War obviously okay let me try to change that so then I bought this hat and it says type literally it has helvetica it says type and I wore that hat so that's the hat that I became known for and then somebody from the internet a friend of mine reaches out and says hey I've got this company called goddess designer would you wear my cap no obligation but I'm going send it to you I'm like well no obligation if it's not cool I'm not going to wear it I get it I'm like it's cool it's helvetica Justified left I'm I'm I'm cool with this so I start wearing the hat and that becomes the thing I'm not even religious that becomes a thing I help his company he's a friend it all works so now I just have a rotation of different hats and it's weird you wear one hat for too long and then that's what everybody says that's you now that has to be you yep so the reason why I started wearing this hat Brad is because when I was traveling in PTO my luggage was stolen I lost half of my luggage I lost a bunch of hats and and clothing so I was capless and I'm speaking and so I've got the shiny head syndrome I'm like earliest possible take me to some stores and I need to go find a new hat and this hat spoke to me because the brand D Squared it says icon and I just felt like I can't wear a hat that says icon that is a little bit too self-important but what I realize is there are these Italian Canadians who have a sense of humor and so there's some sarcasm irony in it but I found the one with the tape on it spoke to me so I'm like I have to get this and now this is the Hat I wear all the time did the Hat come with the tape on it or did you put it on there 100% with the tape on it oh interesting I thought you put I mean there were like probably three dozen hats on the Shelf I walked in there I'm like that one can I have that one so that's that's yeah and I've tried applying tape to my other hats because I think it's really cool but the way this is fused on there you can actually see some of the lettering through but regular tape sits on top of the letters and it's a different effect yeah totally this is fused in there well I uh as a as a man with mohawk I I get it and as an introvert also I get it it uh there's no question that if you have something that's unique um people come to you to open dialogue and if you stand out people come to you to open dialogue and again be careful what asked for but from a business perspective and a connection perspective there is no question that that is an asset and then you get to do what you can to control that yeah funny thing in the real world when I wear that goddess designer hat I was walking down the a way of a Southwest flight and on that flight three different people talked to me and they had three very different reactions which is exactly what I want first one says yes he is second person says is she the other one's like does God exist I'm like all three are are welcome and I'm I'm willing to have conversation with you if you want to so people assume that it means one thing but it's actually open to many interpretations and it's just a fun way to to provoke a conversation which I need help with yeah well you want to amplify it more wear a shirt that says I'm not religious while you're wearing it or atheist or something right yeah totally I would totally do that yeah I love that um chriso I appreciate you carving out time man uh it's been awesome it's super fun talking to you and I think there are a lot of uh a lot of good takeaways for people um you wrote a book called pocket full of do which I want to mention just because I like saying the title and I think it's great but uh where do you want to point people in general what's your CTA for this episode I would love for people who are interested in either personal branding or joining a coaching community of creative entrepreneurs to go look us up at the future.com it's Fu T there's no e at the end so it's the future.com and there's a quiz that you can take and it it it will help you identify like what might be right for you we call this the success road map so if you can go to that that'd be awesome love it man I appreciate it well until next time okay thank you very much pride thank you man a





I try to make my life aligned around this principle to shock and Delight Myself by putting out numbers that I'm like nobody's going to say yes to that and okay we'll make this happen I'm like great first of all that's awesome because it means the world sees you for the value that you are and the potential value that you bring to the table and it's a wonderful feeling to be able to do that but also as you know if people say yes too fast it means that the price goes under what they expected and they want to lock you in on that price before you get any wiser and I remember many instances in my life my career either as a creative service person as a brand strategist or as a teacher lecturer or influencer there have been many moments in my life where I'm like wow they do pay this amount and that got me to believe that there is really no amount of money that you could ask for that someone somewhere would consider unreasonable so what you have to do is you have to consistently level up you have to upskill so that you're in a position where your skills actually exceed what the market perceives your value to be








creative people are just funny like this something great happens and we don't want to do it again something horrible happens and we refuse to change so like are we destined to suffer all of our lives when someone feel desperate and have a fixated agenda and chasing after the money they end up pushing away the sales even if the client is right for them think of money as a thank you note that the more thank you notes you get the more you know the clients appreciate what you do and who here does not want to be appreciated my name is Victoria Dior Wang and you're listening to the future hey everybody this episode's a little bit different because I'm talking to my friend Victoria Dior Wang somebody I've met recently earlier this year first time in Singapore and her and her husband Harrison put together an amazing event they said "Let's run it back let's run it back again just days after finishing." And so for those of you who are like "You were in Singapore what what?" Okay look I asked you to come to me but sometimes I'll come to you i'll be in your time zone and so if you're curious about the kinds of things that we talk about if you're curious about wanting to learn more I think this episode's for you so without further ado I have asked Victoria to kind of come at me with a bunch of questions especially to highlight some of the belief systems that might persist in that part of the world and we're we're going to do our best to break them apart and hopefully answer those questions so Victoria for people who don't know who you are just briefly tell us who your story so my name is uh Victoria Dio and uh I'm the CEO of the Gozone Group one of my biggest passion is education and one of our business is to is a running educational program and we create immersive learning experiences to help leaders business owners as well as a professionals to go beyond success and live an extraordinary life so you can hear from my introduction that's why we are we resonate with Chris so much and we want to bring him to Singapore yes so what's real interesting to me just for some background context is people do reach out to me all the time and said hey come to our city come to our country come let's do something together and most of them are not super credible most of them are not built to accommodate me and to be able to do whatever it is I need done and Victoria to your credit and to Harrison who I didn't know at the time you put together a plan there's a spreadsheet everything was above board and you said we're going to do this super professionally and to your credit you did exactly that you met me at airport with flowers and a private car i'm like uh hey this I feel like I'm in Hawaii there's a vacation here and this feels a little bit different and from the beginning to the end it was uh first class all the way and so you do things differently in Singapore that's for sure and I think I didn't have a whole lot of expectations coming in but leaving I was like this is a pretty cool place in the world quite unique in that there's like a highest earning per capita oftentimes number one two or three in the world in terms of education i'm passionate about education and it's awesome for me to go to a place where people like to to learn and to do self-development this might be my new thing i don't know singapore let's let's go the interesting thing is what my intention is to create an experience so that you want to come back again and again i had a good time awesome we had a good time right we had a great time let's let's let's kick it off all right what are some of the things you want to talk about so one of the first thing I want to ask you is uh since we are going to do personal branding and sales workshop which are the key things and a lot of business owners and professionals have a lot of challenge in that area and I want to this the the first question I'd like to ask you is how does personal branding supercharge conversational sales and I say conversational sales because it differentiate you and many other people would talk about sales and why is this the secret source most people might overlook very good way to kick it off so we we'll talk about brand for a second brand is the accelerant to almost everything that you do and that's not to say that all brands are created equally so you and I both have brands and everyone listening has a brand but not all of us are able to leverage that brand to create opportunities for us to make things move faster i'll give you an example real life example a buddy of mine who is putting together an event in Las Vegas which I'm involved in he told me he's 89% tickets sold already for a thousand person event he said last year it would have taken me another two months of selling to close and finish this thing he thinks he'll be sold out in a week or two and he goes because every year his brand becomes more powerful and he can leverage it more i think this is pretty awesome so he did one webinar that was a multi-hour long webinar had a bunch of guests on and he open up the doors and people just streamed in and purchased tickets and then he would then follow up with a few people and retarget the people who attended and the tickets are almost sold out at this point and he was just remarking this is possible because of brand so if you're an event organizer if you're have a coaching or sales program and you want more people to volunteer to join without having to twist their arm start to think about how you show up in the world whether you give people an opportunity to connect with you beyond the business aspect and you'll start to see that this is like the accelerant to everything that you want that's a very great story about branding and I do agree because when people recognize your brand it makes it easier for them to want to move towards you and it's very hard when there's no branding and you're right about the leverage because I think people don't think about leverage as much and in fact that's one of the mindset that Asian and I believe to a certain extent American Asian American has a similar thing we're so used to working hard we feel that working hard is what gives us the value and we we feel more worthwhile when we work hard and having leverage seems to be uh something that is not in people's top of the mind yeah i want to I want to say something here so we we know that Singapore is a rich country and quite brand conscious if you go shopping in Singapore okay everything's here and what is happening here and this is something I want to talk to the potential local listeners about which is why are we as Singaporeans Asian-Americans expats whatever so ready to give extra money to Western or European brands over the local alternative it bothers me a little bit that there aren't as many not even close by a factor of 100 of Asian brands that have translated into markets outside their local market we become too compliant too blend in too much uh too much desire to fit in that we just don't stand out and we become frustrated and we feel like we don't have a voice because oh I got to I got to cater to the society i got to cater to my parents i could cater to everyone else except for myself since you're such a welltraveled person have you seen somewhere in the world where there's traditional Asian cultures or culture and values that are blended with western ideas in harmony honestly not much i would say okay probably American AsianAmerican head is the closest but still very much indated with Asian culture underlying uh the driving I'm talking about what's really driving us beneath the surface I think I may have an answer to that question which is Japan Japan all right you go to Tokyo or Kyoto you'll see men wear traditional kimonos and and suit dress walking being in one of the most modern cities in the world taking the subway and I'm like "Oh my god." And they're wearing like traditional shoes too which don't look that comfortable like those wooden shoes like so you're in a metropolitan like fastmoving city and you're bringing traditional values and dress into it and so Japan is a really great mix of tradition and modernity and preserving culture and they're very good at preserving culture i don't know if this is true but in in in a time when Japan is being modernized they kicked out all the Westerners and drove out all the missionaries and said you know what we need to preserve our culture because we can see it slipping away and so for a period of time Japan develops in isolation with some trade with the West but it's kind of interesting how they're able to hold on to so many Japanese traditions and have done a really good job up until recently about exporting Japanese concepts if you ask a lot of young people in America what do you like manga anime and they'll list all the things they like transformers and robots those are all Japanese concepts right japanese ideas originally and the most successful comics now follow a very Japanese model of developing storylines that don't take issues but take years to play out so I think there's something really beautiful and it's reference to soft power the ability to influence culture currently right now the country that has the most soft power I think is Korea k-pop Kdrama everything K so we we can see that there is a slow emergence of Asian influence that will then be integrated into western culture yeah you're right you're right in terms of their you know how they preserve the culture while still being a very mon mo modernized city like when I first went to Japan I was very surprised by how advanced their technology is in fact like you say they are very self-contained the challenge with that isolation is that they lose a lot of opportunities and economy has been going down over the years so that's that's part of the challenge of being too isolated while trying to preserve themsel they are also losing out to the rest of the world the question now is since you mentioned that how do we help people understand if they were to join us in the workshop we can help them to blend in more of the both so that they don't feel like they're losing out one of the biggest challenge with a lot of people is the idea of changing something really freaked them out if I go to a workshop do I need to change anything is that your experience too no i would say don't show up uh why go to a workshop and promise yourself you'll learn nothing and change nothing why i mean we'll take your money but I wouldn't show up it's like saying I'm going to go watch this new movie but I'm gonna keep my eyes closed okay that's one way to experience it but why would you do that when we go and seek out instruction coaching mentoring tutoring whatever it is that you're seeking out there's a future state that we think we can achieve and the only reason why anybody does anything is they're motivated to change so sales is about change management so I'm trying to help you go from where you are to where you would like to be so first and foremost you have to identify do I have a need if you have no need stay home additionally if clients are electing to pay you a premium you get no push back they're they're they'll willingly wait for you to be open and available so that they can have the privilege of paying you the most amount of money and when you introduce an idea they're like "Yes I love that." And what else and you get no push back on ideas well also stay home or maybe don't stay home start a course create a conference and teach people how you've done this because this is amazing so we we say this right creative people are just funny like this something great happens and we don't want to do it again something horrible happens and we refuse to change so I'm like are we destined to suffer all of our lives and I do want to say this Victoria I'm not a sales professional i've had zero sales training i've taken zero courses in sales i've gone to see zero gurus teach me about sales so I have a little bit tiny little bit of self-doubt when it comes to am I the person to teach people sales i can get customers i can create content and they're happy to seemingly pay me whatever it is I ask for what is it that I know so I'm in Dubai and I'm doing a talk on how to sell less and close more clients but I'm standing in the lobby of the hotel and this gentleman older gentleman walks over to me he goes "Chris didn't know who you were sorry about that." I'm like "You don't need to be sorry i don't know who you are either i'm not apologizing." Goes "I was at your thing." I'm like "Oh okay cool." He goes "I've been doing sales training for for two decades." I'm like "Uh oh here it comes." He's going to say "What you say doesn't work it won't work here." He says "I learned some new things." And that was good he said "I share that story with you because I find it really fascinating that people who are so-called quote unquote sales training professional ninja wizards teach sales in a way that I find disagreeable distasteful and dishonest." And the reason why a lot of people especially creative folk don't like sales is because they've seen so many bad examples have been taught bad ways of doing it and they've kind of resigned to say "I don't want to do this." And of course if something is grossing you out creating that feeling of ick and you keep doing it well it's not going to turn out well because you're holding on to negative feelings about it i think part of what gets us jaded is uh you know a lot of the people use very manipulative sales tactic just to just to get their agenda met and we are becoming more and more sophisticated and we can tell we just can feel it and and most of us don't want to be like that so we become from jaded to costing ourself and that's why your workshop makes such a big difference in my opinion and I can honestly say I'm a sales veteran and I know exactly what me I have been in sales and entrepreneurship because in entrepreneurship you're selling all the time you're selling people why they should do the the job why they should you know uh whether we like it or not as a leader even we need to sell people our vision we need to sell our team our vision so that they feel more engaged with what we are doing and they can be more productive and perform better and then not to not to mention we need to sell to our clients why they should engage with us if there's a fit but people get So resistance to the word sales and this is the other part in Asia uh I can say that for Singapore and I believe that's probably applicable to the rest of Asia too sales is deemed as if someone gets a sales job or or go into a sales profession is deemed as a lower end kind of a profession because you are not a lawyer you're not a doctor or you can't get a job that's why you you went to you go to sell something so there's a lot of you know challenge with the word sales and how it's how people uh look at it okay let's let's let's clarify here if you're an attorney you're trying to get a client what are you doing i believe that's called sales yes if you do cosmetic dentistry and you need to get clients what are you doing you need a coach that's called sales yes exactly if you're a coach and you want to help people be better partners to their spouses or wherever or their children what are you doing i believe that's called sales so I think sales has a bad rap because there are so many poor practitioners poor examples the Wolf of Wall Street all all these kinds of the Jordan Belelfforts of the world kind of like sleazy cheating people out of their retirement those kinds of things and we think sales we think of used car salesperson we think of time share salespeople telemarketers bothering us while we're trying to have dinner with our family yeah if that's sales it deserves all the spit and fire that it's getting but we're all in the same business and sales is about influence sales is about transference of energy a friend of mine and an art center professor his name is Errol Garrison he said something like this he believes sales is I'm excited about something my job is to see if you're excited about the same thing and if you are then we could do business together but if we're not then I'm I'm happy to go my way part ways and we're good i love that the problem is when we do it as a third party neutral objective observer I have nothing to gain from this i'm just telling you about a great restaurant a hotel car service and since I have no horse in this race I can fullthroatedly say it objectively because there's no self-interest involved when we when we flip it and it's like "Oh I I do logo design and if I fullthroatedly express what I think it's going to do for you oh that's distasteful that's like so self-centered." And there's a reason why what we need to do is to have one conversation not two conversations so when we talk about third party we speak about it very objectively we ask great questions we listen to what the other person wants and only if they're interested in eating a certain type of food or seeing a certain type of site would we then recommend something to them because there's no point in us telling them you must visit this place where we're like you know what I'm tired I don't really want to see any tourist straps I'm good and what we do is we switch gears and we go into selling pitching justifying mode and having an agenda but if we adopt the first mindset and have only one kind of conversation not two kinds which is I'm curious what you're interested in where are you in your business what do you need help with what have you tried and failed who has wronged you what outcome would you like oh my gosh it just so happens that what you want is something that I potentially could provide to you and then it's a marriage of a want with a solution but we never do it this way and we watch people crash and burn all the time Victoria yes they go up on stage they pitch each other and they're just going back to the old what's in it for me mindset and we're trying to break that we're trying to change that 100% yeah that what's that's uh the what in what's in in it for me mindset is what Yeah create a lot of challenges for people and I thought you know a lot of the roleplay you do in the workshop really makes a difference to bring that awareness up like someone from the workshop uh did a really great carousel and talk about how what he thought about sales was so different uh he really shifted the mindset around what's in the way of his sales result uh before the workshop versus after the workshop and the what's in it for me when you feel desperate that's the worst that really uh cost a lot of people when someone feel desperate and and have a fixated agenda vender and chasing after the money they end up pushing away the sales even if there's a right fit even if the client is right for them that's right i want to go back to a question that you brought up earlier about cultural differences east and west now I was born in Vietnam but I grew up in America english is my second language i know some people are bothered when I say it but it's literally true and I I struggled for some period of my life pronouncing polyelabic words multiple syllable words because Vietnamese language is single syllable that's why it sounds so choppy and I've I grew up in America as a first generation immigrant refugee so I still have deep ties and and connection to my culture my original culture while having the benefit of being raised in America and seeing this the the kind of Socrates approach to life exceptionalism individualism understanding ego and what drives me so I straddle two worlds i'm not saying I'm the only but I'm one of the few who can come in and be a day walker that's a reference to Blade what I'm able to do I think is to understand Asian culture our habits our routines our need to be respectful while also bringing in western concepts in-your-face kind of style teaching uh putting people in the spotlight a little bit and blending these two things and I think what I enjoyed so much about our time together in the workshop Victoria was I was given time and space to be the meanest me I could be and to me that is pure joy and if if your teacher your instructor's having a good time there's a chance not a guarantee that you'll have a good time and what what better way to learn than than to have a good time if I'm doing my job correctly you'll look up and you'll look down and you'll realize eight hours are gone i'll make it fun hopefully I'll make you laugh you're either going to laugh with me or people are laughing at you but there will be some laughter and I like that part i like that we can play we can push and we can pull and we can straddle that line between east and west traditional and modern i I think I'm able to do that but you'll have to be the judge well I can attest to that it's true and that's why you get that's why you have a lot of Asian fans and followers who are really inspired by you uh to be an Asian and yes you're Asian America but you are still Asian and to stand out in the world stage is really very hard very tough for Asian community and to address your one of your question that you or one of the comment that you made about why are we so um why do we put podesta on western branding yeah i think it's quite I think it's a it's part of what well you know I like to say to my Asian friends that one thing about American is that you guys are really great at marketing whether you're confident in I'm talking in general right whether you're confident or not you can market yourself so well the opposite is true for Asian so we are human being and I believe from my experience is that we tend to buy into the surface stuff that as long as it's popular it looks good if everybody else like it it must be good which I don't think is true all the time but that's how we are that's our default we we are more geared towards popular uh popularity and any pop anything popular we listen to it so we put more attention to it and the challenge with Asian is that we can do a lot of good work but we have such a hard time marketing ourself and promoting ourself and that's the part that I feel that we can blend in with more of the western culture where by feeling more comfortable in sharing of ourselves and and with no shame so shame is a big cultural problem from confusions that we are being shamed into doing a lot of things that the shame end up costing us in other area that where we can excel but you know we are human being we are one we are a whole person we can't have shame in one area and not have shame in another area so promoting ourself is like a big taboo would you agree with that hey we have a couple thousand years of Confucianism to unpack here so how much time do we have for this podcast and how long is the workshop again okay but here's the cool part the minute you decide you don't want to do anything or do it the same way before is the minute your life can change my life has been full of moments like that where the road or my lifeline branches like that sacred timeline in the multiverse it branched and I chose the branch that was most optimal for me so can you unpack 2,000 years of Confucianism in a day and the answer is it depends and you're like what does it depend on well it depends on that person that you see every day twice a day the person who looks back at you in the mirror it depends on you you know I wanted to say that more people need to go through the same process as you because it is through that process that we ask ourselves those question do I want my future to look the same no and the people who say no are the people who will take action on the other hand the people who give up are the people who just don't do anything there's a scene in goodwill hunting so when Robin Williams says to Matt Damon's character It's not your fault yes I know it's not your fault i know it's not your fault i know it's not your fault you might It's one of those moments with me where I look you in the eye and I'll say "You're enough." And you'll say "I know you're enough i know you're enough so I I I I jokingly say I know everybody's about creating safe space i create unsafe space because in the unsafe space there's friction there's tension and I don't know another way to make a diamond diamonds are made under a lot of pressure and heat i agree it takes tension and pressure to change and can I say just from my point of view even though you say it's an it takes unsafe space but what you are doing is actually very safe the reason why it's safe is because it might feel the feeling might be oh no I got to go through this oh Chris is gonna roast me which is you know we people like to y your followers like to joke about that they love it by the love that you roast them so it's not a it's not a negative anyway and they also know that because of what you do because of how you do it they get to transform and it is through the tension that people transform nothing happen if there's no tension too comfortable that's why learning online has a problem they are too comfortable they're just listening passively uh there's no real change because there's no tension no one challenged them and in my experience my biggest transformation come when someone challenge me because it breaks me out of my I call that it's like a zombie mode where I keep doing the same thing and I thought that I should know I'm doing it right why is it not happening why am I not why am I not getting the result I'm getting and it's a little bit like a I don't know how to describe that it's like I'm being trapped in my own ego of thinking that I know but I'm just not getting it and I can't change it until someone come and challenge me and I suddenly it's like a wakeup call for me and that's what you I feel that that's what you do with people that uh that scramble them so that they they are not in their default mode it's our default mode that's the problem and that's why they keep getting the same results and they can't be challenged online you can't they can't they can't get that online i mean if you can go get it there are people who I'm not I'm not here to prescribe to anybody what's going to work what's not going to work i I almost think it's better that people go to workshops or try things online with lots of different people so that when they experience something that we bring to the table they'll have a point of reference i heard this from somebody i would like to coach people who have been coached before not someone who's never gone to see a coach because they'll know the difference they can see it and they can feel it and they'll be able to say "Oh the last coach I talked to didn't say any of this who wasn't doing any of this." And so I'm I'm kind of a little bit more bought in in this moment whereas a person who's never been coached never gone to workshop never worked on themselves never got any kind of training they were like "Oh yeah how everything works." I'm like "Let me tell you it's not not true." Harrison said this after the event it's like there's no pitch you know a what people don't understand is people invite you to go to a workshop and the reason why they want you to go to the workshop is because they have some exclusive mastermind and then you go to exclusive mastermind then they have a platinum 101 program and then after that they have another program so it seems like they're just designed to extract more and more money from you versus creating more value for you i I I take what I do very seriously even though how I do it is not at all which is you've placed a certain amount of trust in in us made a commitment and I need to honor that as a teacher first and foremost so I want to make sure that you're having a good time that's important to me I want to make sure that there are things that you you want to get resolved in your life and to learn relative to the subject that we're teaching to to make progress maybe it won't be perfect but you're going to make progress and to walk away saying to yourself I enjoyed my time i learned something and I can apply something moving forward that it's going to have material impact on my life and in my business that's the first order first principles whatever we want to call it I got to make sure of that and outside of that everything else is good and that's one of the main reason why we decided to work with you we that's why we want to bring you to Singapore because we are very very aligned with how you do that we don't like pitch two and we know because we have been in education industry for a long time close to 30 years and there are so many workshops or program out there that really that do that every sing they even do it during break time before after and it's just it's just distasteful and that's the part that makes it unsafe because I'm supposed to I just paid money to come here and learn so that I can uh apply what I learned to get the out but here you are every single session you are trying to pitch me the next thing and how am I supposed to feel safe to open up myself to learn the real stuff yeah where else do we go with this conversation i want to talk about value what makes this experience in Singapore command a premium and why are people still saying it's worth every single scent it's hard for me to tell you why it's worth whatever you're going to pay and it's because in in alignment with the things I try and teach you it's not my job to prove to you to justify as to what the value is the price is the price if you feel like if you got some of your problem solved if you can capture that value back that's on you like when I read a book books are in general here in America about $30 each some are a lot cheaper some are a little bit more but on average I think it's about $30 every time I read a book I think I can make 30 grand and that's conservative in terms of the investment so you see all these books behind me if I were to read and be able to apply and teach all the things I've learned in my life I'd be sitting on a giant mountain of money and so when we go to workshops and when we hire a coach and a consultant my number one question is will I be able to turn this into value for me i think Jim Ran said something like this that wealth is and I'm modifying it a little bit wealth is your ability to convert knowledge and experience it in into capital i can become wealthy if I can take what I've learned and convert it into some kind of capital or currency or something else and that's what I do so I've read the book so you don't have to and if you want to read all the books and learn the way I learn go do that it's a lot cheaper but if you want to do it through the lens of someone who's applied it and sort of figured it out and can share in those experiences to create a fun dynamic learning experience and you think I'm the person to do it for you then I'd be happy to be your teacher and your guide for all of this not someone else will be or no one will be that's up to you i'm not overly invested in convincing you to come to this thing now the best person to answer that question are people who have come to the workshop who can say here's what I got from it here's why I would come back and here's why I want more well I know you have a no convincing policy so do we it's not up to us to convince people and I would say that you know at the end of the day like you say they have to decide for themsel what value and what return do they want for themsel if they were to join us and what are they willing to the price they're willing to pay and yes it's an investment it's an investment in oneself but it's really not up to us to decide and we are confident that we are going to do the best job it's perfect okay so imagine that you show up to a Mercedes dealership and we see the S-Class and America S-Class is probably between 80 to 120ish K depending on what you add to it right maybe a little bit more i'm not sure and you walk into the dealership like why should I pay this why is it worth this much and if I were running the dealership I'm like I don't know tell me what brings you into the dealership we just have a conversation about it there it's not their job to convince you at the point in which you walk into the dealership to say "Why is this worth it?" Their job is to tell you about a story about who they are what they stand for and who the customers are so that you make that decision before you even walk into the store that's called branding everybody so why are we teaching branding and sales like what do what do these two things have to do with each other well everything friend because if your brand is really strong you won't have to sell at all okay i have a question let's talk about money you know how a lot of people when it comes to talking about money they feel a little bit awkward yes and they feel awkward uncomfortable oh you know what do I say how do I say how does this experience help them turn talking about money from something awkward into something natural and not to not just natural they feel empowered i think money for a lot of people in a lot of cultures dirties the conversation it creates a lot of tension for us because it takes something that's more relational and turns into transactional thing but I think what money does it takes away a lot of the ambiguity i heard Simon Synynic explain this and I love his explanation of this like what is money really so we just rewind the tape i invite you over for dinner i'll cook and part of the bargain is you'll do the dishes i cook you do the dishes pretty fair right and this is going been going on for some time we're cool and then one day you're like "Hey I have to run." I'm like "Cool um I owe you." So okay I cooked and I'll do the dishes so next time you come over it's like "Let me make good on that i owe you i will cook and also do the dishes." And so money has become an abstraction of this promise of an IOU and it's much more convenient and transportable than I brought two chickens to the dinner so that we're all even right and once we move into this abstraction we start to get away from the the feeling of what is our our will that what is the goodwill that we're creating here what is the promise that are made so what I do is I give you money because I didn't do the dishes but you can use that money to then have someone so close for you and so someone who is not part of the original deal can fulfill that end of the deal and that's how we move as society so the problem has been I think too many of us have negative associations with money if you think back to your earliest childhood memories around money there's a good chance that one of your parents you handled money in a way that you found it to be distasteful i can speak to this i think you correct me if I'm wrong so I have memories of my mom taking me to the flea market swap meet and her negotiating with other vendors and using certain kind of negotiation practices I thought were dishonest distasteful and somewhat manipulative now my mom's a beautiful human being she's like a saint but in Asian culture that's how we feel like we're getting our money's worth by negotiating and hemming and hauling about price and it's very much a cultural thing right especially in the Middle East too there's this idea that if you pay full price you're stupid so as a westerner I'm like "Well no it's not I'm not negotiating with you this is not how we do it i gave you a fair price and if you don't like it you don't have to buy i didn't artificially jack the price up so that you can negotiate me down to the price in which I wanted to pay." But this happens a lot in the East in the Middle East so if you're a little child and you see this happening like oh this feels dishonest it feels gross okay that's the one thing and money all of a sudden then has certain power like if you want to buy a toy or outfit a dress something shoot I got to go make money and someone controls the money i don't have the ability to make money so we take these two powerful things the concept of what money can do in terms of liberating us giving us what we want and while simultaneously saying the ne the negotiation the transactional part of money is ve very distasteful and has all kind of tension built in what we don't know is that when we're little kids we don't have the ability to process complicated emotional experiences so we all put it into two categories one it was good or two it was bad right if you see your mom or dad yell at somebody you're bad don't want that now we're adults we we have the ability to transact we're carrying around old stories with us and so I think also if you're an artist or creative person you're like "Well I just want to make art i want to get back to the IOU system." But instead we have this monetary transactional system that I just don't like it it feels cheap feels like this heart this soul this energy I put into the making of this thing is now reduced down to an abstract thing that can be transferred to someone else doesn't feel right so I think the first thing we need to do is understand what money is and have a new relationship with it and I I I I think I heard this from Blair Ens the writer of the Win without pitching manifesto he said "Think of money as a thank you note that the more thank you notes you get the more you know the clients appreciate what you do." And who here does not want to be appreciated well everyone wants to be appreciated we may not want to charge a lot but we want to be appreciated a lot and so I think the bigger the stack of thank you notes the happier I am the more I know I found the right client to do the best work of my life for and that I know that I'm being appreciated and if you'd like not to be appreciated charge a few bucks and see what happens they will tell you they will not even pay you enough to buy a sandwich so we have to have a different relationship with money and what happens with all of us is we feel a lot of tension and instead of vocalizing what we're feeling we internalize it and it just gets worse and worse inside of us that that negative energy compounds inside of us and so what a lot of creative people do even business types they delay the money conversation to the very very end and they awkwardly because time's running out oh yeah by the way it might cost this you can't just blurt that out at the end it's super awkward really freaking awkward man so your inability to talk about money signals to the other person you're not a good business person and conversely your comfort in talking about money is a sign of good business acumen and all I ask everyone to do is to relate it back to an experience in your life when you walked into a business and you wanted to buy something but they're really uncomfortable telling you what it costs no price tags long process at some point you're probably going to punch somebody and you're going to leave when I go into a store I want to know exactly how much it costs if you want to do me a giant favor tell me what it's been selling for three months ago and what it might sell for in three months so I know when I want to buy this so since you mentioned that uh because a lot of the conversational sales uh that we do that you you help people with is about pricing and uh how do you position yourself how do you charge premium and this is I know this is uh especially for the creative industry but I think uh many business owner have a similar challenge so it applies quite across the board like how do people know whether um they are charging the right price and feel great about it because that's part of what gets in the way of people asking for the price they want am I charging too high too low or is it you know that or they feel good about what they are charging because if they don't they know they are doing good work but they don't necessarily know whether it's the right price or not right well we're we're kind of introducing some concepts here that I want people to be aware of the the processes of sales to me leads naturally to a pricing conversation when you're not good at having the conversational the conversation around sales the pricing conversation is really really awkward if you do this correctly the price will present itself i don't want to get into value based pricing because that's a whole another workshop a whole another day but what I will tell everyone is this is if you can do a few simple things let me lay it out for you okay number one if you could help to determine what a person's desired future state is like where they'd like to be x days weeks months from now where are they now what's getting in their way you've done a lot of good things already so where are you now in your business where would you like to be what's getting in your way what have you tried what has worked what hasn't tell me about that and you start to understand and unpack all this information with the with the client what do you think will solve this problem a lot of questions basically so if you got this solution and it got you this result it would be worth this amount of money to you it's a lot of questions and they said yes am I missing anything no okay so if you were presented with a solution that costs a fraction of the value that was created would you be excited to move forward and their answer if you've done this correctly yes well I have good news for you may I share some insights they're yes why notice X Y and Zed and instead of doing A you did B you would get there twice as fast would you like to move forward they say yes so the reason why you don't know what is fair is because you don't get to decide what's fair the person you're selling to decides what is fair you can decide what's fair for you so what you want to do is you just want to have a conversation so all of us say say it doesn't have to be complicated let's say you sell a $10,000 coaching package that's a pretty good amount right $10,000 coaching package if you don't have a conversation about the value the impact that you create 10,000 is a lot of money that's like two and a half Louis Vuitton bags i think that's a lot or that's a fifth of a down payment towards a a three or five series now fully loaded that's a lot of money and I learned this from my business coach many many years ago is value is contextual nothing is too expensive or too cheap against nothing you need context so the part that most people don't understand is how to structure the conversation around what is the context they're so focused on the sale and the ask and the pitch that they forget about all this other stuff what's the context and that's all I try to do is I try to teach people how to ask the questions to get the context and by the end of the conversation you you know it's a good fit or it's a terrible fit and that's totally okay one last question because this is a very common uh Asian mindset especially in Singapore because you you asked me before about Singapore mindset and since we are going to do the workshop workshop in Singapore i'm going to address that you might laugh at me because you know in Singapore fear is one of the predominant emotion that drive everything okay so we have this saying uh in in Chinese that says that in Singapore we are driven by fear of the government fear of their wife fear of losing out which is for more and fear of death everything is fear based so what would you what would you say to this people when it comes to uh people being so driven around the fear of what if something goes wrong essentially that's what people are afraid of i'm going to tackle this maybe three or four different ways again my my business my former business coach Kier he used to work as a lifeguard and he said by the pool side he's his job is to make sure kids don't drown he goes it's the weirdest thing he's ever seen kids in the pool in the deep end starts a panic fears his death is imminent he says "It's really weird all they have to do is reach out and grab the coping of the pool but you know what they do they swim to the far side and of course they're going to drown so then he has to jump in and pull their butts out so he goes "When we're panicked when we're operating a place out of scarcity when we're nervous about what other people are thinking we're not making great decisions we're swimming to the wrong side of the pool we will drown and your business will drown." figuratively I think what if what if this happens i like what if questions but most of the what if questions are pointed in the wrong direction what if this doesn't work out what if this is a waste of time or money what if a client says no what if they have a better option that's all pointed in one direction the negative direction let's take that same thinking let's orient ourselves 180 degrees what if this is a bargain what if they've been dying to work with me what if they had so many bad experiences that this is going to be a relief for them what if this solution allows them to really focus on their business and grow it to a level in which they've never seen before what if they let me drive the entire engagement what if they refer me to all their rich friends what if this becomes the point in my business history that is the beginning of something amazing what if in a year from now we're celebrated for the incredible work we've done and are standing on stage accepting a lifetime achievement award what if we're on the cover of a prominent business or social magazine what if our account blows up so I like what if it's just pointed in the right direction why are y'all focus on so much negativity next one you're afraid of negative outcomes that's a normal human response so when somebody asks me should I do something they're asking a question again in the abstract should I invest in this property and they don't know what to do so I say well what else do you want to do with your money well I could leave in the bank okay that's one thing i can invest in this other kind of thing or there's a lot of different things where I can invest in myself so well given all the possible options what has the highest upside potential with the lowest potential for downside act accordingly so people usually just ask one question like should I do this i'm like I don't know should you what are the alternatives so we consider the alternatives and then we decide accordingly there's a very easy answer to all this stuff which is what if nothing changes three five 10 20 years from now do you see that version of yourself being happier than today and if the answer is yes don't change anything stay on that winning track very few people are motivated to change when everything's working really well for example if you have six-pack abs you're not going to change your diet and your workout routine because you're at peak performance physical condition right now if you're the world champion you might tweak a few things here and there but you're not going to go and wholesale change everything you're not going to you shouldn't change your trainer your habits your diet uh how you process the game day rituals you don't change all that this is why athletes have a lot of superstitions because they wore that sock they touched this emblem and they said this prayer and they counted to 55 and then they entered the field and they played the game and they played the best game of their lives sports psychologists will say "What is your what is your winning routine do that again retrace the steps." And a lot of this is mental but as we've learned the mind influences the body so when you get your mind right the body will follow so you can imagine a negative outcome and say "Well if nothing changes this is what I've signed up for." If you're content with that do not change anything it would be crazy for you to if you're living your best life doing your best work for the best clients making a freaking ton of money while working less stay on that track so there's a there's a quote i don't know who said it i'm going to say Zig Ziggler but it's probably not i'm not sure everybody and the saying is if nothing changes nothing changes 100% and they would be insane to think otherwise that's cool i think that's a great way to end today's session and I really Yeah I think it's a you know really the what if is such a great question but it depends on where we are how we look at the question yes so I will say this the the podcast goes out to 10 15 20,000 people some people are interested in what we're talking about some people aren't that's totally cool some people are in a place where they'd like to come some people aren't so this really is just a message for the people who are curious who've determined that their best days are ahead of them but it's going to require some action i do want to say this the workshop's in Singapore it's in June and if you want to come read the description in the show notes we are passionate and committed to make Chris do event in Singapore the best of the best and you are going to experience the best of the best the best of of the best Chris because that's what we want from him and we love for you to experience him with us can't think of a better way to say that so on that note Victoria thank you very much for having this conversation with me and dear listener thank you also for indulging me and sharing some of my thoughts and philosophies on personal branding and sales if if you walk away with nothing else I just want you to think about this if your business could use a little extra boost work on your personal brand because that accelerates everything that you do and if your personal brand is really strong learn how to do a little bit of sales and if both suck I have good news for you because I'm going to teach you both that's the best that I can do until next time take care of yourself








So you wanna know my hourly rate?
So my hourly rate's this times this.
So i have a question for you, client.
Why do you wanna know my hourly rate?
I guess I wanna know where my eighteen thousand dollars is going.
Ok, so does that mean if I do work less hours, I should charge you less?
Yea
So if I go over those hours, I should charge you more?
Sure
Really?
Yea!
Ok, so, you're saying to me:
You value this logo taking longer rather than shorter?
So it means: If I just tell you it took me 4 mounths to work on it, you will now owe me thirty-six thousand dollars.
If it's in my budget and if I think you're worth it. But i would also ask: Why would it take that long to make that logo?
I wanna put a lot of effort into it
But I could hire somebody else who would charge me the same rate but do it quicker.
So you value time over money then?
Sure, as a business person, yeah.
So here's the deal: I work really fast. I can come up with a logo, but I'm being punished for me being efficient and really good.
Do you understand? The logic doesn't work now.
That's the problem.
So clients can't have it both ways.
They can't say: "Tell me how many hours, but you can't go over it." I can't put a cap on it.
It has to have some symmetry to the logic.
So if I work less, you want to pay me less.
So then there's a lot of analogies that you can draw now.
Most business people value time.
Remember at the beginning of our talk?
Time is the most important thing I have. That's it.
So if I can do a logo for you right now and you love it in 5 minutes, are you saying it's worth less that 18?
Or is it worth more now? Because I saved you a lot of time.
We can go to market right now.
It's worth more!
So charging by the hour punishes me for being good.
Now I'll tell you want: You can hire four interns straight out of school.
They'll charge a couple hundred bucks total, and you'll wait.
And then you'll say it's not right, but you can't articulate to them and they don't know why.
And you keep waiting and you keep revising and what aren't you doing now?
You're not running your business, Jung.
Shouldn't you be focused on your business?
So my job is this, Jung: I'm gonna give you an amazing logo that you're not gonna have to change for a long time.
A mark that you're going to be proud of; That people are going to look at and clearly understand what it is that you do.
That's worth eighteen thousand dollars.
Today.
Come back to me in a year. It'll be twenty-six.
That's what it's worth today.
That's it.







So, you're saying, you'll charge a rich person more money for the same logo as you would
a poor person?
And I say, absolutely 100% yes.
Scott: Chris Do, the legend, welcome.
Thank you for being here, it means so much to me for someone with your level of success
and influence to join me on just my sixth show here, so I just want to extend my gratitude
and say thanks for being here.
Chris: Thanks for having me, it's a real pleasure.
Scott: Alright, no problem and just so you know, and you probably already know this,
but I'm a huge fan of your work, with The Futur and through The Futur I found Blind.com
and then looked at all of your past work and the incredible projects that you've worked
on, so you have a wealth of experience.
I think it's probably pretty rare to go from the design world to being an influencer in
the business space, so I think what you're doing with The Futur is really interesting
and I'm curious about where it's headed because I see more of your content now being more
generalizable beyond design and I think then that's awesome and just creates tremendous
opportunity for you.
Could you provide just a little bit of an update on what you're doing with The Futur
and the future of that venture?
Chris: The future of The Futur?
Scott: Yeah, exactly, I didn't want to say it.
Chris: Okay, it was set up for you to say it that way.
The future of The Futur.
2018 is going to be a year of massive growth for us and so we have to kind of think about
whatever's worked in the past may not work moving into the future.
We took a poll with our audience and asked them what kind of content, what kind of format
is most appealing to you and they're asking for shorter videos.
It wasn't a landslide vote but it was mostly like 60% short videos and 40% livestream so
we're dialing back the livestream considerably, and at first I was a little resistant to that
because we got used to getting into the state of mind, we're going to produce three livestreams
a week, which is a lot of work for us to do but then all of the sudden I find it quite
liberating.
I have all this free time, I don't know what to do with myself.
So we're writing and produced more content, I'll be writing more articles but I think
you're right on the tip of that which is if we speak to a very narrow audience this is
great but it's not going to help us to get in front of a lot of people and that's what
we need to do.
So we're trying to produce a variety of content, so we'll go really micro and do or like one
or two minute videos on how to do Photoshop or Illustrator, Photoshop hacks or things
like that, so you can learn one new useful thing to use really quickly but then we're
also doing very broad content about mindset and what it takes to be a successful person
in the world.
Forget about you as a designer, what do you need to do and to share a little bit more
of that, so we're trying to bring all that to bear plus we have some really superstar
guests coming on and that's always, I always hope it'll do better but it's kind of interesting
when it does or doesn't perform, but we got guys like Andrew Kramer, founder of Video
Copilot coming on, if you're in the motion graphics world and you learn anything about
animation or compositing, you've heard of Andrew Kramer and I've known Andrew for a
long time.
We're not close friends or anything but we've known each other for a long time.
I’ve got G-man coming on and there's another person I've known for a long time and, he's
big in in terms of the motion scene, he's a director and we have, of course, Aaron Draplin
coming on, the big man, thick lines, all that he's coming on.
And so we're trying to just elevate the guests who are coming on and to give our audience
access to people that normally would not see.
Scott: That's incredible, and it's comforting for me to know that so, for me you're a huge
guest so it's good for me to know that there are other people out there that are big guests
for you, right, it's comforting in some ways.
Chris: We want to give our audience who they want.
Scott: Right-right, exactly and coming into this when you when you agreed to talk to me
I really was excited and then I was a little bit stressed out because I was racking my
brain trying to figure out what do we talk about, because you have a lot of breadth where
us as academics, you know, I'm kind of an inch wide and a mile deep on a few different
topics where you've demonstrated a lot of expertise in branding and in pricing and negotiation,
so a lot of topics that could really be beneficial to my students and what I ultimately landed
on, because I think that I under cover the topic, and a lot of students don't think it's
interesting or sexy is pricing.
One motivation for that is that you had a really popular video on your YouTube channel
which was pricing for designers and I've watched that video a couple times and it's a workshop,
and I'll post a link to it in the show notes, but a workshop, where you're kind of writing
on a whiteboard and really kind of drilling the audience to give you feedback to figure
out, you know, what prices should we be charging for a logo and I just, I really like the way
your mind works and the way you kind of walk through that process, so that was probably
the main reason I want to dig into pricing.
The other is that I view you as having kind of a unique expertise in that you've priced
services, right?
You have these design services that you're selling to clients of all different sizes
and you've also… especially now with The Futur, you're pricing products, so you sell
a lot of different toolkits and you sell a subscription to your Facebook group and I'm
sure the thinking that goes into pricing all these different categories of products and
services is much different.
So it wouldn't be fair for me to start by asking you how do you price things, but I
thought that we might…
Chris: But you're going to do it anyway.
Scott: I'm kind of doing it in a roundabout way.
I thought we might start by talking about what pricing variables are the most important
and, you know, it might depend on certain things and we can talk about what those dependencies
are.
So what variables are most important and in what order do you kind of work through them,
so you know when I teach marketing we'll say things like, oh you know some businesses they'll
charge their cost plus they want to make some margin, so they'll just do a cost plus model
and add in the margin they want to make.
Others will look at the customer’s willingness to pay and then kind of base their price on
that, so there are a lot of different strategies business use with varying levels of success,
but what's your strategy or your recommendation for kind of laying out the variables that
matter and then working through them?
Chris: Okay, I don't have the same kind of academic experience that you're talking about,
I don't necessarily think in these terms and variables so bear with me as I kind of work
through my process of explaining it to you.
Scott: Yeah and I think that's a good thing.
Chris: Now there are products that we sell and there services that we create but I think
the unifying theme here is that we price based on value to the end-user and a lot of people
have a problem with this and their general gut reaction is “so you're saying you'll
charge a rich person more money for the same logo as you would a poor person” and I say
absolutely 100% yes because the value to the rich person is very different than the poor
person.
And let's abstract it a little bit and talk about big businesses versus small businesses
because the terms rich and poor tend to create a sense of judgement and I'm not judging a
small business differently than a big business but big businesses have a lot more to gain
and a lot more to lose when they take an initiative and it goes wrong and so the bigger the business,
the more they have a chance of it failing and people getting fired.
On the flip side of that, small businesses mom-and-pop businesses the ones around the
corner, they don't live and die on a marketing campaign, they don't live and die on the introduction
of a new product or a rebrand.
Most people will frequent a small business, a local business because there's a relationship
with the owner, the staff, the service and the quality of the product itself, so in this
case changing a logo or changing something that wasn't in need of change actually might
hurt the business.
I frequent a chain of fast casual restaurants on the Westside called Tender Greens, they
recently went through a rebrand, I think Paula Scher did it with Pentagram, and there was
a strong negative reaction from the community, like why did you do this?
Why did you change all these things and we don't like it and they're still dealing with
that right now.
There are business reasons why they decided to do that but this is the main difference
between say an IBM versus the cafe around the corner, is that if they need to update
their brand there are bigger global objectives perhaps when they move into foreign markets
that name or that mark has negative connotations.
These are things that the small business would never have to consider, so those are some
things that you need to think about so you need to price the customer and not the product
itself.
What's the value to the customer, now when we talk about products no problems… go ahead.
Scott: It is controversial like you said to have this differentiated pricing and you know
sometimes we in marketing talk about channel conflict which is, you know, you're charging
one price to these wholesalers, this other price to this group of wholesalers, and then
that creates a lot of conflict when they find out about that differential pricing, so but
I think what you're saying makes sense… so the value of that brand or that logo that
you're creating is different for a big company and the risk that they're bearing is much
greater right, in failure, where the small company, if they don't like it or it doesn't
quite work out, they can probably retool it without a huge, making a huge sacrifice, on
their business, so I think it makes sense.
Chris: It shouldn’t be controversial though, it should not be controversial, Scott.
Because think about it when you drive to a gas station, depending on which block you're
on the price changes depending on which chain.
Arco gasoline much cheaper than Union for whatever reason because of the brand, because
of the positioning, how they compete but you know that you already are part of the system
where the price isn't fixed.
One person walks into a dealership buys the same car for more money or less money than
the person who just left, why is that?
And there are a lot of different reasons, maybe because of their ability to negotiate,
etc. but there are fluctuating prices even in a commodity market.
If you think about it when they sell, when you're talking about differential pricing,
and when they sell to one retailer at a different price than the other they might get upset
you're right, but if one customer, one retailer, buys a hundred times as many products, they're
going to get preferential pricing because they're buying in such large volume, it's
very different, that's also the reason why I think in different business models like
when you go to a Costco, you can buy products at wholesale because there is no retailer,
the supplier, wholesaler is… they're all the same and so that's why and we participate
in this all the time, and I’ve talked about this before in pricing, right?
If you buy a can of soda at Costco it's going to be 20-cents when you buy it in a 24-pack
but then you got to bring that thing home, you got to unpack it, and then you put it
in the fridge and then when you go somewhere you have to bring it with, you might put in
a cooler, that's the why when you go, when you're at the beach when it's hot, there's
a vending machine… that same can of soda is a $1.50 or $2, same can of soda because
you need it more, you want it more, and you're paying for the convenience of them unpacking
and chilling it and giving it to you so you don't have to deal with the hassle.
Scott: Right, I agree with you and I think that maybe the reason I said it's controversial
or the reason that it may actually be controversial is that when people think about cost, so this
is from the customer’s perspective, they're interested in your effort and when they see
that you put the same effort in for the mom-and-pop shop as you do for the big business then they'll
think that they're getting treated unfairly just because they have more money.
Chris: So yeah, I think there's an issue with ethics or perceived ethics and as the same
amount of effort went into something and then you're changing the price and it seems very
dishonest and I think your assessment of it being controversial is correct, I don't think
it's just yours alone because I hear all the time.
People are like you're a criminal you're crook, you're dishonest, you're unethical and they
can say whatever they want.
This is not my idea by the way to say price the customer, this is from somebody else.
Value-based pricing is not an idea that I invented, I'm just practicing it that's all
and if you don't know anything about business when you hear about this in the first time,
it does seem like it's a different language from a different planet, it is seem very antithetic
to the things that you might believe.
Alright, now let's talk a little bit about products if you will because you were mentioning
that too.
The products that we create and how we price our products is dependent on more factors
than I would with service, and here's why.
In the service space you're basically hiring us and our unique way of thinking and our
point of view into the world.
The making part is not unique.
Everybody can make something, so you're paying for that.
For which then, I think, there is few if any competition for, therefore I can charge the
price that I want and not have to be so concerned that market forces dictate that I price it
at a certain price point.
Yes, you can get it done on Fiverr or 99designs for that price but you can't get us to do
it and if you want our thinking, our clarity then you'll pay for that.
When it comes to a product, this gets a little bit trickier.
It's still a unique product to us but for which now there's all kinds of competition.
Unfairly, people will start to say well I saw something on Masterclass for $99 and they
had a celebrity.
So you're saying to me the video that you make is worth that much or more and so it
becomes a problem.
And so we're competing against the market forces if you will, even though I believe
when you watch our video and you pay for that course, you will be a richer person for it
in terms of what you know or what you can charge or how you can handle yourself in a
client meeting, so you'll make money off our video.
I can't say anything about those other classes.
Scott: Right, and maybe it, maybe what you're talking about there with the market forces
will… and certainly it will change over time, right, as your reputation grows stronger
and kind of The Futur diffuses through the marketplace and you get a lot of positive
word-of-mouth and especially as you start to grow beyond just design then then you'll
reap those rewards in the future and then maybe you can charge discriminant prices depending
on who you're selling to.
So if you, we even talked about this a little bit, but if you sold me a package or you sold
my university a package, I would expect you to charge us differently than if you're selling
an end user, right, or a designer right a package on how they should pitch a client,
so what you're saying makes sense, I think it's just so uncomfortable from the customer’s
point of view that it's something you always have to fight against when you're meeting
with customers because they'll say things, and you mentioned this in that that great
workshop video that I mentioned, but they'll ask you well how much time are you going to
spend on this, or what's your hourly rate, and that creates kind of a problem in our
mind but I think that you work through that in a pretty methodical way that that makes
sense.
So, can you talk a little bit more about how you determine what that value looks like,
so I'm yet I'm going in to sell my product to this company I'm in some B2B services exchange
and I've done my research on Google, but I still don't have a good sense for, you know,
what their revenue looks like or the size of this business.
Chris: Okay, there's a couple of things to think about and I think the reason why some
people are shocked about the concepts that we talked about is because our client base
is very different than perhaps the client base of somebody that's out there just graduated
school.
We work with Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 1000 companies, and they are in the hundreds
of millions of revenue if not in the billions of dollars.
Their net worth is ginormous and so when we talked to these people, generally speaking
I try to gauge with them what the initiative is and what it means to their company, so
I'm not going away and just bidding in the dark I don't like to do that.
Blair Enns has a new book that's coming out called “Pricing Creative Services” I believe
or something like that and he says you should say a price before you show a price so we
often will talk to our clients about the general ballpark, the budget, and what we do is we
price bracket and we anchor high so we're trying to understand from them what the value
is to them, and what you don't realize as the designer on this side of the equation
is they're coming into the meeting with some sense of how much they need to spend and what
this is worth to their company, and it's your duty to try to extract that piece of information
from them in the least a non-confrontational way, so that we can have a real adult conversation
about business.
A lot of creative people don't understand that business people work fundamentally like
this when they say we need to buy raw materials, we need to buy iron or steel or something
they need to be able to talk to them like what can I get per ton and if I buy 200-tons
of this on an order or if they could promise you future business what kind of price can
I get, so they're already talking about numbers or thinking about it in their mind.
It's just the awkward creative person who doesn't have a lot of business experience
walks into room thinking this is going to be tense filled like how do I talk about…
I can't talk about this, I mean if I mention it they'll think I'm crass and I'm not a creative
person when in fact they're sitting there thinking “I wonder if they're ever going
to bring up the money.
I have no idea, what kind of shock is this going to be when they send us the proposal”
and they almost want you to say it.
Scott: Yeah-yeah, of course and is that difficult for you because you're selling, I don't know
if you would term it this way, but brand elements or something like a logo that could potentially
over time improve brand equity, which these are somewhat nebulous in that you know you're
not talking in terms of sales dollars necessarily.
So I give you this logo and you're going to make an extra million dollars next year it's
really hard to say that, so when you're selling a product like that how do you go about that
conversation of trying to figure out the value?
Chris: Right, so we were just talking about this and I don't sell the logo, I don't sell
the website, I don't sell the packaging or anything else, what I do sell is in a way
I'm selling myself, I'm selling the strategic thinking and the clarity that I provide, so
what we do is we try to elevate the conversation away from what it is that we do, what we make,
and this is a trap that a lot of creatives have.
They don't understand that who they are is different than what they make, they bundle
those two things together and if you think about it I was making this analogy to somebody…
if you were to cut off your finger are you less of a person without that finger?
Is that finger you and the response is no, so we've cut off your hand, we're going to
raise the stakes here, is that hand that's now detached from your body you and the answer
is again no.
I'm still me, so I guess most people would describe myself as their brain, their heart,
or their spirit, or soul is what makes them right, so when we go in and try to talk about
our work and what its value is they attach themselves to it and now they can't separate
it and these are different things, these are very different concepts.
So what I want to do is I want to detach what I make and what I do or who I am is the way
I think.
So what I want to do is talk to the client, engage them on that level, so I want to ask
them…
okay great, you come and you've asked me to design you a new logo.
I can do that for you, actually a lot of people can do that for you and quite well and at
a wide variety of prices, but what I want to know from you is what is driving this conversation?
Why do you think you need a new logo?
So now I transition from talking about, oh what kind of logo do you want what's the look
and the feel, and what logos inspire you to why are we even having this conversation in
the first place?
And that's the first sign that the client recognizes I'm not just like every designer,
I am going to drive deeper at a problem and so in that way I imagine it in their mind
is your value just went up by a couple of zeros.
And you might discover in a conversation with your potential client, the prospect, that
they don’t actually need a new logo.
There's nothing wrong with their logo, aesthetically it's fine.
It could be a little bit better but fundamentally if we help them fix maybe their app or the
user experience in their store or maybe the decor is really off.
Something is off and this is when the client is prescribing their own solution which is
a dangerous thing.
I need a new logo.
I need a new this.
Well, let's diagnose the problem before we prescribe a solution, so now I'm in the consultative
selling mode where I'm working like how doctors, psychologists, engineers work.
They asked lots of probative questions and they're trying to figure out what are we doing?
That's really what I'm selling.
Scott: Right-yeah that's great and these laddering techniques, this is something that we teach
all the time because, you know, you can ask someone why do you want a razor blade that
has five blades and they'll say, oh you know I want a closer shave, but then if you keep
probing then you can start to get content that you can use in advertising.
So, you know, why do you want a close shave?
I want to be more attractive to other people.
And then you start figuring out what kind of advertising I'm going to put… or imagery
I'm going to put in my advertising.
It's very powerful to kind of try to get to the ultimate causes which for business might
be, oh we're losing market share or something like that.
Most designers are never going to get at a problem that big and be able to relate what
they're selling to that problem so it's a really interesting and tactical thing that
you're doing here which is probably why you're so successful.
Chris: Now you bring up a great point.
I want to talk about this a little bit.
This is the difference between selling features versus benefits.
So if you're writing out an ad campaign and, so for all the creative people that are watching
or listening to this, you might talk about five blades it's titanium steel, forged in
this kind of thing and you think that's a great ad.
But when you keep asking these why questions you're driving into a fundamental need of
root emotional reaction to this.
It's because I want to be more attractive or I want to have this boost of confidence,
so this is one the benefit comes in which is an emotional thing because I feel more
empowered because I want to walk into a meeting feeling confident, whatever it is that that
makes you feel, the kind of root motivation it’s much deeper truth.
So you can have a balance of both, more blades to make you feel confident or whatever it
is and that's looks like, wow okay I get it now feel five times more confident with these
blade.
Scott: Yes and that balance has shifted over time so if you look at modern advertising
almost every advertisement now is making an emotional appeal at the you know at the top
level and then at a secondary level they're talking about features.
And usually it's only effective to talk about features if the if that target consumer already
knows a lot about the benefit, and they're like okay now there's this new feature to
the iPhone, so maybe you can talk about that, but yeah it is it really is about getting
at those fundamental, universal needs that are present for your target market, which
is an awesome lesson that spans beyond just pricing.
This is for everything, right?
But if you're trying to drive that price higher getting at those fundamental needs is going
to help you considerably, you know.
I'm from a consumer psychology background so one thing I always wonder with practitioners
like you who are out there and you’re pricing products and you’re pricing them differently,
is how you factor in the psychology of different customers that are in your customer base.
So I imagine the psychological mechanisms that are happening for executives at Nike
are much different than that mom-and-pop shop right, so you might want to price really high
for Nike because they'll perceive that it's very high quality, right, where have those
price sensitive customers at the at the lower end of the spectrum and you have to be really
careful about what their perceptions are going to involve, you know risk of going under because
they're spending too much money on a logo or something along those lines.
Chris: That's right and I think most people feel that if a price is higher there it must
be better whether you’re Nike or the mom-and-pop shop.
I remember an episode on Penn & Teller where they talk about water, how drinking water
in the United States for the most part, unless you live in some contaminated areas, is actually
just as good if not better than fancy bottled water.
And so what they did was they brought people to a fancy restaurant and they served water
from the hose or the faucet in the back and they talk about it, so they have like the
equivalent of a sommelier I don't how to say that but the wine expert which is the water
expert.
And they just talk about it and the guy drinks the water and he says to his date, like, I
told you this place was good check it out and they're just like laughing in the back
it's because it's perceived it's all packaging and perception.
Sean Archer talks about this.
Your perception your lens that you look into the world actually has more to do with how
you feel about it than the reality itself.
Scott: Yes, yeah, the water story is funny for me because I was by when I was in my Ph.D.
program, I was buying Smart Water all the time and my wife would make fun of me so she
set up a blind taste test for me where she bought I think six different brands of water
and then asked me to rank them and I ended up ranking the Whole Foods store brand at
the top which is much less expensive than Fiji or Smart Water which I would tend to
buy.
Chris: Very expensive.
Scott: Yeah and I joke about that with my students too because I'm a marketer and I
teach marketing but I fall for the same tricks that that everybody else does which is one
of the fun things about marketing.
Chris: But you can't not help but to fall for the tricks because as part of our human
nature and how we've developed as a society as a culture.
You buy things that you believe in so when you buy Smart Water because as electrolytes
it helps you kind of be more balanced, there are some benefits to that and so you buy into
that whole thing because it says something about you whereas if you buy cheapo Crystal
Geyser or whatever it is, it's like oh I just I'm just I'm a commodity buyer I don't care
what I put in my body so it says something about you.
So from the headphones that you're wearing to the car that you drive, you're consciously
or unconsciously making a statement about who you are on what your beliefs and values
are, that is why you will often go out of your way to the coffee shop that is like three
blocks farther away than the one that's right next to you because for whatever reason that
says something about you like… it could be a mom-and-pop so you drive past three chains
it could be the exact opposite where you drive past three mom and pop coffee shops because
you want that consistency of the chain and so there's an association, attachment to a
brand and that's just part of human psychology.
Scott: Yes, and it’s… and even though objectively it might be silly for me to buy
Smart Water yeah if you could argue if it makes me feel better or if I perceive that
it tastes better than it is worth the additional money.
Chris: Then it is better.
It's the placebo effect right there, I feel smarter I feel more balanced and you start
to send these positive vibes through your body and then you get better.
There's a great story on I think it was Radiolab how there were faith healers and there was
an investigator who went in to infiltrate faith healers and what happened was… the
long story short, they realized if they just make people believe that they're going to
get better, that 50% of time it's successful so the exact same success rate as traditional
Western medicine, so faith healers are just as effective, it's really bizarre, and so
they're saying like for little things or for everything, it's like for even for cancer
it's bizarre, so your body has an incredible ability to heal itself and there's some science
behind this too.
So, if you believe that Smart Water makes you smarter, more balanced and you release
the chemical compounds in your brain, it actually does make you feel smarter and you are smarter,
right.
Scott: Yeah that's, and I'm glad you brought up that story, because it's interesting thinking
of, you know, that and there are some, you know, holistic healers and people like that
who will tell you to kind of meditate and imagine your body attacking the disease and
things like that and you're right, objectively it seems kind of silly to some of us, but
it's effective because you know it's psychological and also the way that our brain functions
can actually result in some healing which is absolutely fascinating.
Chris: Yes, there is some science behind this before people are going to these guys are
off their rocker right now, right, so let me explain the science.
They're saying that the chemical compounds in your body exist and like when you take
an aspirin or a Tylenol it recognizes that the compound, it's just you happen to be deficient
in it or there's a concentration of that chemical.
It only works because your body knows what it is so if you have a headache you pop in
an aspirin or something and then it releases that so then it can chill out your head so
you don't have a headache anymore, but your body actually naturally produces this so if
a faith healer comes in and you believe in it enough they're like you know what, you
won't have this headache anymore your body starts to release the same compound.
There's lots of stuff obviously that people we have yet to discover about how our bodies
work but there's some science behind this.
Scott: That's cool, I knew when you agreed to come on the show you would take everything
in an interesting direction, so I appreciate it you're so well-read and you’re kind of,
you know, you're really tuned in to everything that's happening which is amazing because
I imagine you're also tremendously busy, so I appreciate you bringing that insight to
the conversation.
Chris: Hopefully we haven’t lost the entire audience at this point.
Scott: No, I don't think so, I think it's interesting, I think it's fun.
And I want to be sensitive of your time but I wanted to ask you one more thing because
you're, as you know, you have you're managing you know multiple businesses and all kinds
of different product types, so I could see a scenario where you set a price and then
that's kind of the price forever.
Your Facebook group is one example, I think the entry fee is $75 for a membership so I'm
wondering a little bit how you set that price, but what's more interesting to me is how you
manage that price because of course you've set expectations of the existing members,
but if you find that like you have 5,000 members then the group will become unbearable.
So do you kind of use pricing as a control or you realize that they the values a little
bit higher than we thought it was but how are we going to do all this without ticking
off all of our existing customers?
Chris: Right, I think you'll like this story.
I think, and I believe in this, that if you want to reduce friction transitions are very
important.
I teach transitions in storyboarding going from moment to moment so there's flow.
I talk about transitions as you're doing a presentation to a group of people how sometimes
it's abrupt when you shift gears so you need kind of a segue piece a story or a slide to
kind of help to gently ease us from one arc to the next.
Our pro group used to be free.
It used to be open to the public, so the first decision I made was I want to make it a private
group.
It can still be free, my partner at that time Jose is like why would you do that?
Because I want to create a safe place for us to discuss real things and to be not concerned
that this is going to get back to their clients, he goes okay, so we did that and then I said
okay now that it's private I want to charge $25 per month, so why do we do that?
Because I'm spending a lot of time managing, directing, having conversations, doing webinars
with this group.
He says like okay so we lost a bunch of people because you know it's hard to pay for something
when it was free, yes.
But a bunch of new people came in and so each cycle we kind of wash out the people from
before and we bring in new people.
It's 25 bucks a month and then I was talking to somebody and I said you should really join
this program and we're supporting each other.
He says, you know, I thought it was a joke what kind of value would I get from joining
a group that's 25 bucks a month and I thought about that so I raised the price to 75 bucks.
Because there's two reasons why.
One is perceived value, if you pay more for something it must be more valuable right and
to probably just as equally important is I wanted to hurt a little bit.
When you don't pay for something, you don't use it.
I need it to hurt just enough so that you feel connected and committed to it and we
will probably be raising the price again because the value of the group is getting higher and
higher and you're right, it'll become unmanageable when it gets to a certain point and it would
just be bananas.
We’ll have to splinter it off into multiple groups depending on what level you're at,
maybe you're an agency owner, small to medium sized business owner, or just starting out,
you’re a student or solopreneur, and we can do that so we can service the community
better, yes because there's a lot of crosstalk, right?
Some people are students, some people have been running their businesses for some time,
but yeah so I think it's about that financial commitment.
Here's a little story I want to share with you, there is a business coach that I'm aware
of, I don't know his details but my coach was telling me about him, and he lives in
the middle country let's just say he lives in the Midwest somewhere and he's well-known
well-respected.
So the CEO of IBM might seek him out but he has very specific terms.
You must come to me, I do not come to you and why would he do that because he wants
you to have a certain mental commitment to working on this that you're going to dedicate
the time, resources and you're going to take this seriously so it's not a power play.
It's really to the benefit of the end-user and it's not to say you have to come to me
but I think those concepts are really important.
Scott: That's so cool and the other thing I'm wondering because you talked about these
transitions or segues then that you can use them for pricing, so do you imagine that if
you go from let's say $75 a month to a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month that there
will be some kind of like roll out like this is our content plan for the next six months
or the next year, so that those 75 dollar payers have, you know, you have less attrition
among those existing customers.
Chris: Right, we did the same thing from 25 the to the 75.
I said I appreciate you guys and I want to reward you for your loyalty so for a limited
time, you can purchase in advance a years’ worth of membership at the low price of 25
before it flips over but this window is closing really fast.
So you have 30 days to decide if you want to be here for another year but you have to
buy it in a year… a year's worth, otherwise you're going to pay the new price so we saw
a flood of sales just come in because they wanted to cash in on that before they got
booted out or before the price went up and if you think about it at $25 for a year, three
or four months in you have gotten basically the membership for free if you were paying
at the new price, so yeah we try to do that because I don't want to leave anybody out
in the cold.
Scott: Yeah and it's good for you and them but also there's that awesome kind of a psychological
boost of them thinking they're getting something that's a lot more valuable than what they're
paying which always feels good for us as customers as you know.
So, I feel like I've already eaten up too much of your time.
I want to talk to you all day I'll be honest because I think you're an awesome person,
you're a great storyteller and I think that your mind works in a way where you can make
connections naturally and you know very comfortably where it's difficult for most people, for
me and for most people that I talk to.
So I appreciate your time, I think I'll probably pester you down the road to talk about something
different but I promise that I’ll give you some breathing room and if this show hasn't
grown up a little bit by then then I won't even ask you, okay.
So I'm going to put, I'm going to put in the work to make my audience a little bit bigger
but I just want to reiterate that I'm very thankful for your time and your guidance…
and I've hired you for a few hours as a consultant too so I consider you kind of a mentor of
sorts for me so just thank you for everything and we'll chat again soon.
Chris: Thank you very much.
Scott: Alright, thanks Chris.



hey you listen to the say okay creative podcast a podcast where we discuss creativity process business and more with the goal to inspire and equip both young creatives and entrepreneurs
I'm your host Jayden say Kay and it's a privileged heavy listening hammer my outlaw podcast Spotify or YouTube in today's episode I'll be talking with Christo from the future a YouTube channel with over five hundred and fifty thousand subscribers with Chris and his team talk on the business of the Stein in the design of business wherever you're listening from wither in the car
subway or at work have your notes open because Chris is about to drop some incredible tips and tricks which will help you grow as a creative entrepreneur so for the first time let's give a big welcome to the one and only Christo from the future and blind yeah I'm so excited to be speaking with Christo today so welcome Chris thank you so much sister honored to be your very first guess yeah I'm really proud to chat with you today um you're a bit of a legend in the design and creative business world but for those listening who haven't heard of you before Chris could you quickly introduce yourself
sure my name is Chris doe and I founded this company called blind which is a motion design firm based in Santa Monica California
I've been running that suck that company since 1995 that's a sole owner about five years ago I started this other company previously known as the school now the future where we started to teach creative people the business of design of the design of business that now has become my sole obsession in life and I've pretty much essentially stopped taking on service work and I'm focusing on creating content for creatives awesome I think there's like no better way to describe your creston like the spider-man or visual creativity I like them I've heard of your story of how you came upon design and it's almost like you're but the design buggers I'd say and you became a bit of a hero having creatives of all ages and stages unlock the creative gifts and pursue the patient you've described your discovery of rest of our graphic design is the scene from pulp fiction where john travolta and samuel l.jackson open the briefcase and money and the light shines out of it trying to like those cloud padding moments
now could you share the story of how you entered the design world as a young person I first saw Jaden I loved the two references you know you got me at spider-man and bug I like that I'm a Marvel comic books
person myself so so in my instance the the magical moment the the case opening up now there was not a case of cash it wasn't that obvious but it was this idea that I wanted to be a creative human being I just didn't know what shape that would take and not having a lot of examples this was pre-internet this is the 80s now I'm trying to figure out like what my life is going to be like or I'm sorry the 90s and right I'm not quite sure it's not until I'm sent on an errand to pick up some typesetting which I'd even know what that was back then then I met my very first real-life graphic designer and when I entered his studio and it saw everything that it could not visualize in my head it just appeared before me so as I stepped across the threshold of his home office I stepped into this world and this would change my life forever I saw on his desk a very classic Mac 512 K beige old I had a massive box which I later discovered was a laser printer and he had a drafting table with all the things that you would normally think of if you were going to be a designer t square triangles and 4p do crafts pens and markers comps of different packages and he just blew my mind I knew then and there that I was going to be radioactive
I was going to be a the Gothic designer yeah awesome so cool
yeah so you were a tracer is that right yes I was there was a tracer
I was inking over my boss's drawing say it was a screen show
yeah I think and what you're saying you know back then you know with all the um you know vintage mix and stuff and how the world had changed so much since in as a graphic designer you know you've got great resources like you know like the future to help young creatives grow so could you know that kinda like talked about the contrast of entering the design world back then versus like some of the creatives you hear of nowadays so pretty much by the sound of your voice and everybody that is your age it's hard for you guys to manage
life pre-internet and happy times day that was a reality so this is when you have to go to the library you have to look up people's phone numbers in the yellow pages and make phone calls and this is pre cell phones this is the life in the world that I was living in so the resources that were available to us for a very finite so back then when you call vintage was cutting edge stated that our desktop of her yeah year one right this was amazing thing so when the the laser printer came to life and it would whirl and kick out this heat and then all of a sudden a sheet of paper would come out and he showed it to me I thought it was magical
now this printer bear in mind
probably cost seven or eight thousand dollars printed a hundred dpi and he's as big as a small refrigerator maybe a little bit bigger chief it's insane and now you can think about like buying something at Staples for three hundred dollars and getting a printer that is not that much bigger than your laptop yeah that's that's where the world has come with that all the things I have changed are in parallel like what the printer doesn't default by itself the computers the the phone that you have in your pocket is probably a hundred times more powerful than that Macintosh that Dean was his name used in that day and age there's so much that you can do now in the palm of your hands that we sometimes take for granted now yeah there's also this information revolution to that there are creators such as myself because as much as I like to be the only one who does this
obviously not there's an abundant amount of resources the vast the internet is a fast and free media playground and just about anything that you want to learn can be found mostly for free on the internet if you know how to search yeah that's really an insightful thought like I think as young people take it for granted you know you just hop on Google or you know YouTube you don't know the answer um yes so I've got a question from someone they asked how do you most sorry how did you most efficiently spend your time when you're at Unix you went to design school is that right
the I went to art Center in Pasadena yeah so they're wondering how did you most efficiently spend your time when you're at uni and we're learning how to design they're often told by the electrodes to sit down and work 9:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday as if we were and they were in a job scenario but would you recommend this in
how did you work
okay so we're all given the exact same number of hours and every single day whether you're rich poor if you're black white or Asian it's the same amount of hours yeah
the question of highly productive people and why they're able to seemingly stretch or steal more time it's like how do they do that one I think they have a very clear goal in their mind what is it that you want to do because when you get clear about your goals it allows you to make better decisions and making a decision is hard without a clear goal at that time when I was going to school
my goal is very clear to literally be the best designer in my class mm-hmm and that's what I wanted to do I wanted to rank at the very top and there was an objective way to measure this because you could submit your portfolio every single semester to get it graded from a score of 1 to 100 and my goal was to be the highest score person that's so inspired and I was able to do that not every term not every term but most terms that I felt like wow this is really good
so that means other people who were thinking about maybe going to a party a chilling out
just hanging do whatever you do in college my decision was how do I be that number one person well when they're doing that I'm gonna spend my time in the computer lab and when they're out partying or drinking or fraternizing with other people I'll be in the library looking at books and magazines and consuming as much visual information as I could even today even today with the internet being vast and powerful as it is there are still things resources pictures photos articles documents that have not yet been scanned and documented in SEO and indexed so that you can find easily so being there in that space I always wondered where is everybody else because I'm gonna be here now the idea of working 9:00 to 5:00 is a crazy idea to me not like it's if this is what you love if this is your passion
there is no punch in there's no punch out this is what you love if you're in uni and your desires to be a fashion designer an industrial designer or a graphic designer
this is your life this is your blood it should not there should not be any separation so I would be shocked if anybody can go to school and work from 9:00 to 5:00 and just clock out at 5:00 and be done this is it and if you don't feel that same passion that love the same energy there's gonna be somebody in uni that's gonna be like me
just 20 years old who's gonna help maneuver out hustle and help produce you every single day and if you're not number one then you might as well pack it in as far as I'm concerned
yeah wow that's really a really great way of putting it
and you mentioned portfolios in the air like now Eva days you're probably back into you definitely need a portfolio credibility is huge but for young creatives who might be in high school you neo or are working but want to swat air switch career paths in a skilled in design or at least interested in it they don't even portfolio you will just have student work what would you recommend a first it being like hustling to work a small local companies who aren't the type of companies they want to work for what other methods would you recommend to get them out of the ID or a patient stage into actual playing clients I think when you're young and you're starting out I think the tendency and the desires to work with real clients and I can understand that but I would encourage you not to do it right the reason why is because you're still figuring yourself out and the client is probably going to under pay you you're going to be an overhead you're going to stress out and you're gonna do work that's highly compromised because you're not that stage in that game where you have a lot of credibility and you're not going to be attracting any kind of client
the only kind of client you're gonna attract is one that can afford to pay you something and you'll say yes so the work that you produce though real in quotes is really boring too sure
and people ask this quite often is if it's not a real project will anybody care and the answer always is no they don't care they just care that you know how to design yeah Wow
I think there's a lot more value in doing something that's good that you're proud of that represents the kind of work you'd like to do and then something that is half as good but you were paid to do it that doesn't mean anything not in the early stage yeah Wow and I think even in the later stages of your career it still doesn't mean anything
good work gets more work that's it period that's so good
and yes you so talked about you know client we talked about clients and stuff so my question is but you're probably just asked us nine times out of ten but how do I find clients like actually solid clients when you are you know got a bit of a portfolio together and okay so the way that you get work it's very
simple formula I've said this many times before is you have to get known people hire who they know like and trust so you could be the world's best fill in the blank but if nobody knows who you are they can't find you then you're not going getting work so the secret to getting work is very simple make it easier to find you than your competitor make it easier to find you versus your competitor so you say like John and Mary down the street they're doing something they're super interesting but they haven't worked on their Instagram they haven't posted things on Beyonc they haven't done anything to make it easier they have it an SEO optimization they haven't done any of the basic things to make it easier to find them they're not participating in meetups they're not going to conferences and events they're not having their portfolio reviewed they're not sending out samples we're doing cold emails or doing warm follow-ups they're not taking of a boss or a mentor to lunch just to pick their brain those are the things that you do to stand out and to be recognized by people who are in a position to hire you and that's it
yeah wow really good um
now another person asks and you talk about cold emails and stuff so how do you turn a client snow into a years okay
that's a tricky question at very tricky you have to understand why they're saying right you have to understand why they're saying no no usually means one of two things it's like it's not a good fit so you have to understand what are their needs and are you solving their needs or they just need more information usually it's the latter the two so if they say no to your budget maybe they need to understand what goal you're trying to solve and I if we start to look at the problem through the clients eyes are not our own I think it gives us a lot of insight into how people make decisions so think about it have you been in a position before yourself where somebody's asked you to do something that you're uncomfortable with or don't see value in that at all
then the answer is most likely yes you have been in a situation so why did you feel that way what did the person do how did they communicate to you and usually the answer will be something like this they didn't take the time to understand what it is I need hmm right so if somebody knocks on your door and they want to sell you
carpet cleaner shampoo for your carpets and and they're like pushing real hard to sell you this cleaner and then you open the door and they see that all you have hardwood floors that's why you say yeah true so I think a lot of creative people walk around with a very specific skill or in a tool and they think everybody must need this thing and then they forget there's another real-life human being in front of them that actually has a real problem that needs to be solved but you're not open to it because you're looking for a very specific thing yeah that's fresh that I love something like this
all right the expression I love that I want to share with your listeners your audiences this is that you find what you're looking for so what you look for you fine okay so if you are looking for a very specific problem you don't see anything else you don't see that they need a marketing campaign or they need to fix their social media account or actually everything about their design is okay but they're really poor and customer service because you weren't looking for that kind of problem yeah
so you ignore it yeah that's so good
a lot of the thing about you know don't sell shampoo cleaner to a people with hardwood floor and I think that is such great least so much you can apply to whether you're a designer or a entrepreneur or whatever you're doing well I hope you're finding value in this conversation with Christo
this is the first episode of the say okay creative podcast and we're just getting started
we've some amazing guests coming to the show in the coming weeks so if you haven't already and are listing an epic podcast Spotify and YouTube hit that subscribe button to keep up to date with all future content we also have an Instagram profile with short snippets quotes other great content on the topic of creativity let's head on over and give us a follow at say okay creative to join the conversation so anyway let's head on back to the conversation where we're talking with Christo from the future
so the next question I've got is how do you put boundaries in place with a client so let's say they're really pushy and they want to be they kind of want you to copy and paste someone else's design off Pinterest instead of you know it's kind of like that stealing over being inspired sort of conversation over again or you know they're just really controlling but and want you 24/7 sort of think how do you put those boundaries in place okay usually people who behave and think like this tell you this upfront from the very first moment that they meet you because you need the work because you're desperate for the work or because you're really not good at paying attention to people yeah you ignore these signals and then you start to work with them and you wonder like why are they always browbeating me mm all right they're always pushing for me to work on the weekend they told you at the very beginning and you can read people's energy your gut is going to tell you what they're going to be like so what you should do in the very first encounter is just try to envision working together with them what those days and nights are going to look like is this someone you're going to be happy to answer the phone when you call you a certain period right it's this person that's ever going to be happy with the work that you do they always like not sure they know it when I see it kind of person
well indecisive people don't make for good clients yeah they are their opinion in there and their feeling about you changes with the breeze so one day they love it the next day it's the worst thing they have ever seen
are they bipolar I mean I'm not saying anything as bipolar people but when one day they're angry and happy what I don't understand
yeah for sure so those people tend to be fairly unpredictable
I like clients who know what they want and here's the rub
usually people are very successful usually I'm always you know what they want they money to spend any value their time so I would say that those are the kinds of people I like to work with I like to work with successful entrepreneurs who are open-minded who are fair who have a good sense of business and earn ethically bound to like a cure in accordance the way that they see the world I like those kinds of people yeah awesome you know I know if like lots of young young creatives and I think even business people that try to grow
but steam get kept and the general factor I've seen behind this is they don't have mentors all the mentors haven't been to the level they want to reach what is your advice to creatives who don't know anyone or can't find a mentor to help them go to that next level okay you do not need a mentor you do not need a mentor a mentor says you must give me your time in exchange I will do something for you that who knows if it's a leap or not I think Michael Beirut said this just hijack your mentors you write you basically you you can follow people that have no idea that you're following them you can find a hero of yours and say look what are they doing what books have they read what podcasts have they been on where have they been interviewed where else can I get more of their content because here's the thing and I'm saying this in a very broad statements I hope I don't offend everybody it's listening to is most of the times people who reach out to me who want me to mentor them have done the least amount of work in trying to conceive ready spend a lot of time sharing it's so that they read the articles I told him to read had they had they watched a half of her half of the videos we've made are they taking notes on anything and you only they haven't they asked really lazy questions because they want to be spoon-fed stuff yes what if I were to take on and then tea that's not the kind of mint tea I would want to take on anyways
that's so good yeah because you've also got their book list on the future website is it correct that feel like people yes yes I have many book lists yeah I think if you haven't looked at that and you're looking for mentors really urge you to go and check it out it's just on your like you'll be able to see a link on your website a well where do people find that yeah and if you don't know how to find it you basically look at this and you're gonna you're gonna probably laugh most the people spend more time asking me what it is that they need to find than just actually finding it there Chris I can't find your book list anywhere I'm like oh let me see let me just double check out go into Google I type in crystal book list and there's the top three results yeah so you took more time crafting a stupid message to me
then it did you have the same result
yeah right I mean if you just spent a minute just searching for it the future Cristo book list books to Rabbi Cristo it's gonna appear we try our best to make this information available exactly
it's so true so that's not sending me a great message that you are a person I should pay attention to yeah yeah great
now someone asks have you been swayed to do anything else other than graphic eight they say design and I simply know if a point in your life when you've been tempted to check the talent those are two very different questions okay so let me answer number one have ever done anything other than graphic design and the answer is 100% yes I do many things outside of what you consider graphic design for example I've designed the interior to space as a showroom for one of my clients Co I've designed the exterior two buildings for one of my clients so design design doesn't have to work graphic in it until you add that word in yeah
design is just a means to solve problems so you can do culture design you can do you can do management design you can do innovation design so design is just trying to figure out a novel solution to a problem so when I said earlier before if all you've got is carpet shampoo and that's what you're selling that could be interpreted as one very specific form of design for example if you're a hand lettering artist you do calligraphy well that's your carpet shampoo that's what you make for me I try to go into the thing it's like I got nothing to sell I want to learn about the client what their goals and their objectives are what they hope will be coming and listening and trying to understand why they haven't been able to achieve that and once identify something I have to make a decision am ia good person to solve that problem or is somebody else that I know can solve at home
and if it's one or the other I direct a conversation in one way or the other way and sometimes it's me who can solve the problem and sometimes it's not at all yeah for sure
so the idea of just doing graphic design I don't need to be persuaded cuz I just do what needs to be done yeah great
the second question is have I ever felt like giving up and throwing in the towel
and truth be told I have thought about that on occasion and when you go there here it can go really dark really fast and you can start to question yourself the the goal here is not to stay in that state of self-loathing but bring it back to the self loving side so when times are tough when things aren't looking up when you work all here and and you manage a team of 18 people and there's barely any money in the bank account you start to think about am I just being insane am I just banging my head against the wall and those are moments of truth you have to ask yourself and dig deep within you to see if you've got this if you can do it or not yeah some people quit and some people don't some people solve the problem and some people just keep repeating the problem over
yeah for sure
um now I've received another message asking this as a young creative nearing the end of school or just beginning University would you recommend specializing in a particular design skill early such as graphic design or you know whether its interior calligraphy photography web design etc or focus on being an all-rounder so essentially the question was should I specialize how do I nice down and as how specific do I go there's kind of a 33.0 but yeah so I'm gonna answer the question with a question myself which I says are you getting enough work do you have a lot of opportunities more than you have capacity Wow
so if you answer the question is yes I'm getting a lot of leads I have a lot of opportunities don't change what you're doing then you see if you're a specialist or generalist just keep keep doing it so if you're asking that question if you're answering the question and the answer's no I don't have a lot of leads and opportunities ask yourself right now
am ia generalist or am i specialist yeah I'm gonna predict the vast majority of you are generalists you can't get work because you show no depth show no mastery you've not put in the ten thousand hours into making something and and learning the skill this is where the the very difficult tasks a specialization comes in because you have to make the active decision to give up stuff to be better at other stuff you
so you got to give up the stuff that you're not that good at doing so that you're going to become better at the stuff you do like doing that you're good at and this is a very difficult thing for people to do especially in the creative space
we're lateral thinkers we don't like to stay in a vertical space you have a vision and our thinking right so we like to bring lots of things together and probably a little dose of a DD or ADHD yeah and there so that's that's the real problem if you find it that you're it's hard for you to find opportunities it probably is a sign that you haven't focused enough that you start to become known as the person not a person but the person so not a graphic designer
the graphic designer right yeah
an illustrator the illustrator that's what you're trying to do
yeah that's Wow
yeah really good so vector nation gown let's say your okay so I'm a graphic designer and there is working for let's go back to the cup
cabott stuff so I'm a graphic designer for a well you know for a carpet shampoo and company should I how specific do I go if I want to work with a carpet company do I go to a point where I want to work for a carpet at me that only sells brown colored carpet or how specific do that okay that's a very good question
so when we start to specialize we start to find out who we are for the natural conclusion of the sumption a lot of people get into ups that have over niched down I've made my target market so narrow there's only five people in the world who can hire me now those five people spend a billion dollars a year in marketing and design no problem yeah one of those things will sustain you for the rest of your life and that's a worried that a lot of people have and and for the many years that I've been doing this I've yet to meet a single person who's over an itch like it hasn't has gone down so narrow there are no clients left to support you
yeah so when you think you've niche down so much that they you can't go anymore go a little bit more right you're trying to get into this ideal zone where there's somewhere between 20 to 100 kind of clients who can hire you
that's a good number right because once you start to establish expertise there right 20 to 100 people could hire you one
you were able to service them what's really cool is people who meet you and say well you don't do exactly what it is that I want but you do that thing really well they assume that assume you're good at everything it's called the halo bias right
yeah when somebody's really good at one thing you think they're automatically go to other things so when they see that you're really good lettering artists they may offer you to design their packaging co or their signage or their website but the opposite is also a thing you need to watch out for so when you show no no real skill of doing anything they assume you're bad at all things this is the power of niching and specialization awesome okay now this is the following thing it's kind of a generalist statement and I know lots of creatives are gonna get annoyed or it doesn't apply to them but I think the majority of creatives are perfectionists and over-analytical to a certain extent I heard you say that the number one thing that is wrong with young people is that we think we have a lot of time this following question is coming from a university student studying design but I think applies to literally every type of creative whether you're right at musician entrepreneur or whatever how do you get over a creative block with working with deadlines
okay so deadlines are the thing that makes you deliver otherwise all of us work on all projects forever yeah and I believe this that creativity expands and contracts to meet deadlines we've done some of our best work at very short deadlines and some of our worse work with really long deadlines because we start to second-guess we start to kick things around and we lose the kind of raw energy the passion the pressure that you feel from delivering something and we just spread it out so thin that it just becomes an uninspired piece of work I don't look at deadlines as a problem I look at them as friends so when something is due in 24 hours do the best you can given the time make decisions quicker and you'll be surprised at the results that you get I'll make this real real for you for everybody as a concrete thing it used to take me about eight hours to craft an Instagram carousel post and I would do this once
every two or three days because I have to work
yeah to do other things I have a team to check in on right but I made it a challenge made a challenge to myself I made it my mission to get to s no more followers by the end of the year so I did the math I had to post twice a day no I cannot dedicate 16 hours a day to do Instagram posts for any long story tonight so I did something very different I said to myself between now and lunchtime I'm not gonna eat I'm not allowed to eat until I finish a post Wow
so that deadline made me think faster made me commit to things and you know I learned something by giving myself less time I designed better carousels well how is that possible well what I was doing is I was over obsessing and packing in too much information when I was working on for eight hours I thought that can't be enough I'm gonna add more and those posts are underperforming the ones that take me 15 minutes to do
why because I respect the audience's time when they're swiping through the carousel they're moving pretty quickly yeah so when I over pack each slide I lose the audience and that's the opposite of what I want to do yes so good and you know what a lot the art is it like there's not one finite solution coming back to the thing where we talked about time frames and stuff but on the negative side of it you know there's not one finite solution is that there isn't a right or wrong answer and the thing I know which young creatives keen to struggle with is the fear of rejection dealing with a client or boss who thinks your creative solution isn't just like the right one and I'm a massive fan of polo shirt from pentagram do you know Paula of course yeah
and if you're a graphic designer I'm listening and haven't heard of Paula I recommend hopping onto Netflix and watching this episode of abstract the outer design and there's an episode all about to it and it's really good but anyway she talks about the line of the reasonable level of expectation
you know you begin to present you go way above the line and it's like the max height of appreciation someone makes a rebuttal slightly below the line and then you make some concessions and you get slightly lower and it's like the highest point and you need to in their meeting the meeting at that point otherwise it's going to fluctuate further and for
under the line till you know you get to that point she called Saturn death
so of course how do you deal with criticism Thalia when working with stakeholders the way that I'm able to do this with criticism is I don't attach myself I don't attach my ego my identity my once hopes and styles whatever it is I - to myself after I don't attach that to the work the work of the byproduct what it is that I I think and do if I trim my toenails I'm not sad that I lost a toenail effective it was just a marker in time right and we think about this maybe when you're growing up your mom and dad might have marked a wall our part on the wall with a pencil saying this is how tall you were at six years old this is a how tall you are at eight years old and that's just a marker so the work that you create is a reflection of your worldview at this moment in time granted if you look at the work that you did three years ago you're probably gonna be disgusted by the work you did yeah because you've grown your tastes of change you've matured and you're gonna keep doing this for the rest of your life so why become obsessed with the work that you're doing right now this just represents a moment in time a sliver of your creativity so when I create work I first remember it this is not for me it's for my client and I'm here to solve a problem so if they're being critical it's because I've missed understanding I misunderstood the problem and I've I've created something that they don't want her life so I have to understand let's go back to my misunderstanding what is it that you want and I'll work with that otherwise when they gave you feedback when they give you a critique or criticism you push that away you reject it you can't hear it and your relationship is strained now you're not going to get any closer to the answer by by ignoring what the clients want there at the end of the day driving yeah so you have to pay attention to what's going on
though I don't invest emotionally into the work once I'm done with it
I just let it go hope I'm in a follow-up today a listener asks how do you measure this the success of each completed project or piece of design work they usually feel very satisfied when I feel like I've delivered something
solves the problem to the best of my ability to the budget I was given with the deadline that was handed and that the client also understands and appreciates the same thing that I do and I think once we get to a point where there I am you know more
that's awesome work a love it then you know that's a real average what is that sort of thing from stakeholders we can get quite complacent sometimes and then someone asks how do you prevent complacency and within your work well if you do work as a reflection of the skills you've already learned you can come become pretty complacent pretty quickly I always look at projects and assignments and new clients that's an opportunity to learn something new it doesn't have to be earth-shattering world shifting new it could just be I didn't know that you could use that tool in Illustrator to make this thing because I spent the time to look at it
so my goal in creating projects isn't so much to finish it it's actually to enjoy the process itself and learn as much as I can while doing it
this makes me a happier healthier person hope and to following on from that what are some practical things you do to find new perspectives and creativity they help you become more creative as people could say than you already are
the number one secret for me in creativity that could be applied to anybody whether you're 16 years old in high school still or you are in the third part of your like career the the secret to all of this is to give yourself a platform an opportunity to create work with very short deadlines and so that you can iterate over and over again and you can learn from what it is that you do one other component to this secret which is you have to be able to get feedback from people so if you iterate in a room you don't know if it's working or not you have to put the work out into the world you could share it on some platform anywhere in a gallery on social media on Instagram whatever and see is tracking well are people engage with the content are they sharing with friends or they bookmarking it if they are start to ask yourself yeah why do people like this post versus that post why did this one underperform and let it out one really just blow it out of the water once you start to figure this thing out you're going to
to learn so much are you going to start to innovate the key here's not - could become precious with your work
and rather than make one project in a thousand days make a thousand projects in coats awesome you've had a pretty amazing career and have the op-ed the opportunity to work grow an awesome agency work with amazing clients you've got an awesome YouTube channel that inspires hundreds of thousands of creatives and entrepreneurs and in the words of Gary Vaynerchuk you've crushed it
how are some ways that you stand out become more successful and what steps would you take to become more to take to achieve your goals better okay so the word successful means different things to different people so I think it's important that each person's listeners have a clear definition of what success looks like to them let me give you an example if you're a definition of a success is I need to make $100,000 a year well then you're going to figure out how to get there if your definition of success is to pay your bills and spend more time with your mom who's ill and your family your your little one and your spouse well
that's successful so you have to learn how to manage that and it could just be all about relationships for you or achieving a certain kind of peer recognition so success is dependent on each person - fine
but if you want to have a shot at achieving it you must know what it is so we all could use a little bit more time thinking about what it is we want from life and writing it down and making that part of our habit or routine to say this is what I want these are the steps that I need to take to get there and to hold yourself accountable to measure as you go and make adjustments to say over time your plan can change even the goal can change but at least you're aware of it
I think that's a big problem for our people they kind of wander around in life hoping to find a goal hoping to find a purpose but I'd rather have a plan that hope yako now your agency blind has done some amazing work for some major names and I've got a few questions here related to the business side of things so the first question is what is some practical advice you would give to an aspiring entrepreneur it's a math equation burn practical advice I would give
yeah that's kind of an open question but I'll try when you're starting out as an entrepreneur I'm going to assume you're some kind of creative person is that you need to learn to think like entrepreneurs you need to think like a business person that all the things that you were taught in school may not be as relevant as you think like there's a law of diminishing return in improving the craft if you want to be an entrepreneur what you do need to do is to learn how to speak the language of business you need to understand what key metrics matter to your clients you have to understand marketing branding positioning strategy sales and negotiations and bidding those are the kinds of things that you typically do not learn in a design education and if you learn that then you can speak the language of business people and they're gonna feel like wait what kind of no yeah yeah and you understand me and you get me and you're not talking about pantone 4 7 7 o dude or coded I'm sorry and you're not talking about which version of what typeface is disappear yeah cuz at the end of the day they just don't get cash or Co now you talk about branding being more than a logo a name etc yeah
so a lot of people use the word branding synonymously with identity design or logo it's become so ingrained in us that were like that's a cool brand man and we don't understand what that means
so a brand is a gut feeling it's like what people feel about the company and the way that that is communicated to them is this totality of everything that they've come to experience with a specific product or service so that means that the product is well made and well designed that the packaging is good when they bought in the store the customer service was amazing if they had a problem somebody followed up with them and over time you start to expect certain relationship and patterns of behavior that then you choose one company spraying over another so designers get in the world and they just make a thing you make a logo you design a poster and you think I'm doing branding now well you need to understand it's just one small sliver of many many things because no matter how good you are at designing a mark let's just say objectively you've designed the world's best logo
mark but the company behind it talks to their clients in you know in a way that's not conducive to building strong relationships they're dishonest they break their promises or products fall apart they don't return your phone calls well are you really designing a brand no you decide to mark so this is where I think we all need to take a step back and say first let's use the right terminology that helps us out a lot and if we desire to be in the branding space we'll start to investigate and spend time learning about what that is and then you can actually participate in those discussions in an informed way awesome yeah now I've got another question about business um
so someone asks what was the biggest mistake downfall or trial you're faced in your business and how did you recover from it okay very good questions couple of mistakes that I made I'll tell you the biggest mistake I made which was when there was time so feast when it was the dot-com boom yeah of the early 2000 late 1990s it was amazing time there there were so many clients calling this for work that the only way we could get some control over our schedule was to keep doubling our rates and we would just say like whatever the budget is telling me what double Wow and they would say yes no way so it got to my head it got to my head in the sense that I thought that this was gonna happen forever that this would never run out that we finally figured out the secret formula to the universe and we're just bringing in so much money it's ridiculous like we were back then buying the LED displays from Apple Wow
yeah that was on K peace for everybody in the office like boom everybody you guys get a display like Oprah
doing the mistake yes
the mistake that I made was assuming that in this time it will last forever and of course it didn't because the dot-com bubble burst and then the money went away and then that made me realized that in times of peace you should not take it for granted you should expand your capacity you should make some risky business decisions to either acquire different talent or do different things because it's going to eventually end
when it does you've prepared yourself with the right team with the right business model and I didn't do that so that was one big mistake the other big mistake that I make on a fairly consistent basis is trusting people when it shouldn't trust them and not reading the contracts carefully enough right yeah Co now we've got a few little extra questions here and what is the month of selling part of your draw today the most fulfilling part of my job is to be able to help people that have never met and probably in in it can never ever repay me for what it is I'm doing I'm sharing very openly very transparently how you want to create a business the skills that I've acquired in the past and as I'm learning in real time sharing that in the most open way that I can and and to me to get the messages the DMS that people send me and saying you you've helped me accomplish X Y and C looking in very tangible terms and when they say I used to charge $300 for a logo and now I'm doing projects that are 30k you've you genuinely and in materially impact in my life and the people that I care about so thank you so when they say that to me that is the best part of my job awesome okay now we've got three quickfire questions here so I'm gonna is real quick and number one what has been your greatest moment or highlight and working in the design field probably working on a music video for the ribbon oh cool
and number two what is the most fulfilling part of your job that same thinking but yet if you could quickly just put into one word helping people achieve their dream right and number three what is the single piece of advice you would give to a young creative don't be so afraid of putting yourself out there embrace the platforms that exist even if they might not work out awesome
well that's all the questions we've got for you Chris thank you so much for joining us on the first day of episode of the say okay creative podcast it's been an absolute honor to have you on and I'm sure people are gonna be like blown away and really blessed by what you have shared with us so thank you so much thank you thank you so much joining us today on the say okay creative podcast I hope you've learned a thing or two to help your your creative journey once again thank you to Christo for joining us

here's the big lesson that I learned when you get to a certain level in your life and you're working on projects north of $200,000 you have to understand something the clients can hire anybody in the entire world so your level of competition has completely changed if you're using a minor league strategy to play in the Major League it's counterintuitive that if you just keep doing what you're doing today that you'll just keep growing but eventually you hit a ceiling or a wall what got you here won't get you there so I needed to learn something to
different and what he taught me allowed me to double my business in one year what's up beautiful people the video you're about to watch is my presentation that I just did here at rgd design thinkers it's called Natural Born seller to tap into your natural gift to influence and persuade people all right hi everybody so happy to be here I feel like I did something wrong and I was sent to jail because it's been like four or five years since I've been here I'm so happy to be here
a couple different things number one is I just realized something and that I've been doing something wrong all my life I've been saying Toronto and the tea is silent it's so I'm supposed to come out here and say hello Tana is that right okay you learn something new every day okay some points there uh I'm going to jump right into my my presentation here and hopefully we'll have some time for some Q&A the first thing I wanted to share with you is I have this observation this observation is that when we talk about sales we tend to think
that if you're big boisterous extroverted energy then you do sales and if I know my people most designers are introverts just by a show of hands how many people self-identify as introverts okay all right and everybody else what are you doing here because it's not real right so here's the problem the problem I see is that the the extroverts are gregarious they're Social Butterflies they have The Gift of Gab you know what I'm talking about they can walk into
to room full of strangers and strike up a conversation and feel like family right away and I'm outside in the window looking out in the cold like how do I do that cuz I can't and and they're they're Charming they draw people to them and they seem to get all the glory and this is a struggle I think a lot of creative people deal with because you're in the back room you're doing the work the good work and you don't get the reward I'd like to change that and perhaps one of some of the most famous sales people are people on this list but I want to draw your attention to one person
in particular Jordan bord he's the The Wolf of Wall Street you guys have you seen that movie Leo DiCaprio Wolf of Wall Street and so he's doing all these aggressive things and manipulation and and selling a lot of junk bonds and so we kind of have this impression that you have to be like this to do this so what about all of us what are we supposed to do and I'm here to try to empower creative people to make a a living doing what it is they love so we kind of have to entertain this idea of sales and I'm not talking about just selling your idea selling your vision
I'm talking about sales like sitting in front of a client and be able to do a business transaction with them so if I were to ask you all how do you feel about salespeople what kind of image would come up to your mind maybe they're very aggressive manipulative and we have that classic used car salesperson vibe that we get from them and I don't know if you've ever been the victim or had sit through a times share sales pitch I have it's horrific so don't
go for the free breakfast Nothing in life is free okay and I almost bought a Time sh I didn't want so you get this really icky feeling about it and so if we walk around we have this impression that to sell is to be like a snake well then we're not going to want to do it or we're going to have a bad attitude towards doing it that feels fair right if you hate doing something you're not going to get good at it so I think what we do is we need to have an alternative to Mr Jordan Belfor The Wolf of Wall Street
one where it's more permission based where you're actually giving or creating value to others that feels in alignment with who we are that's led by curiosity and given in the spirit of generosity that sounds a lot more pable right but that's probably not the image that you have of a salesperson so I'm going to help to reframe sales for you today so that you have a healthier relationship with idea of sales I'm getting messed up I'm stand over here okay so couple things you need to know number one
sales is change management have you heard of it described this way change management okay so I'm going to hopefully make a case for this concept here so another way of looking at change management is somebody wants something and can't get it this could be your client wanting a customer your customer wanting a certain result and you helping them to figure out what that looks like and how to get it so you just have to ask yourself two questions what do they want and what's getting in their way and because we're in
a room full of designers I made a graphic for you much simpler okay so just three parts just remember these three parts number one is there's a current state where you are today and then there's a desired future state so all of you I'm going to make this assumption that you're here today and you've given up some of your free time given up some of your resources and the things you have to get done on that to-do list because you want to achieve something there's a result that you want to achieve that's fair right and so then you go buy a ticket to achieve that result
so if organizations like this understand you really well what they need to do is communicate to you the desired future state that you're interested in so some of you want to network some of you want to connect with people you've not seen in a really long time some of you just want to escape the house and get out but some of you want to learn something that you can walk away with today that you can apply today and tomorrow to change your life so we know this that if there's a current state and a desired future State there's something that's getting in the way so if you want to be more
effective in your skills of persuasion or helping clients achieve that you have to identify what's the obstacle or the challenge that's getting in the way that's clear right there's no obstacle then there's no friction they're already in the desired future state number two you have to understand this that people know this already you know this as well that only by spending money will the problem go away I give you a really basic example if you need to make a flyer and you don't have a printer you know you have to go to a print shop
and have it done if whatever reason your plumbing explodes at your house in an really inconvenient time and I guess there's no convenient time you know that the only way you can do this is either you know how to fix it or you have to call somebody to come to your place and fix it we have to spend money to make a problem go away so it doesn't feel so gross and people already know this when they're reaching out to you now this is a critical piece of information how much they spend is proportionate to the size of the problem relative to the person
who's buying not to you but to them so what you want to do is you want to start looking for big problems to solve as it relate to the potential buyer of whatever it is that you do small problems small budget big problems big budget number three when a prospect reaches out when they call you when they shoot you an email when they slip in your DM you are already qualified so many of us feel like oh how do I prove myself to them what do I need to say the fact that they're taking out time from their
day to reach out to you means they've seen enough already so you don't need to sell them at all so at the beginning of the conversation you have goodwi and everything that you do afterwards is either going to erode or build on that will to build or diminish trust keep this in mind number four and I think this is something that once you realize is realize this it takes a lot of pressure off your back and that not all clients or not all prospects or clients
they have at least three options that I'm aware of they can hire you of course that's a preferred option they can hire someone else or they can do nothing at all so when I started out my career as an entrepreneur trying to build a design practice I always felt that there was only one option anybody ever feel this like you must hire me that's a lot of pressure to feel to have on that call so you're bringing a lot of nervous energy and it's going to affect the way you talk the way you behave and the way that you listen so
when you realize this is great because your job on that call in that meeting is to help them understand their problem and get clarity about what they need to do so they can make the best decision for themselves I know you can hire someone else so let's have a conversation about what your needs are to see if there's a potential good fit and if there is one that might warrant another conversation and sometimes the best thing you could tell them is I don't think you need to do anything at all so we don't want to sell
what we want to do is we want to help the clients align or we decline align with their goals with their resources with their outcomes and get them over their challenges or to say this is not a good fit not a good fit you don't have a real problem or you don't have a problem I can solve so we're going to make this shift we're going to go from being self-centered talking about what it is that we do how beautiful that we how how beautiful the things we make are and the equipment that we use or our process we want to shift away from us to focus on
on the clients so we have to have an attitude or a mindset of serving others we we use this word in two areas that I can think of usually in church and usually in the military thank you for your service we're willing to do something put someone else's needs ahead of ours number two is we want to shift away from giving advice or advising people what to do and what we want to do is get really good at asking questions beautiful open-ended questions which we'll dig into more a little bit
later we want to shift away from talking and listening more and you could use you could play this game whoever asks more questions wins whoever asks more questions is in control of the relationship think about that and then just listen the next thing we need to do is when the clients tell us about the last bad experience they had with a creative what we need to do is we need to look at that and feel that with them and empathize with what they're going through we have to empathize
in that they have a lot of other problems that they're dealing with not just the one that we want them to focus on and this is how we build meaningful connection with people and the last part is instead of selling we want to summarize so we want to serve we want to ask listen empathize and summarize and that happens to be This Acronym of sales we're going to reframe it have the mindset of service we're going to ask more questions and the cousin asking questions is listening we want to empathize and we want to summarize and if you do this and you
you follow this exact framework you'll never have to sell again or at least you won't have to sell in the way that feels super salesy um I was really attracted to this book written by Zoe chance and the book is called influence is your superpower and so Zoe posits this idea that we all have this natural ability to influence people pre- language when you wanted to be fed as a baby you know what to do when your diaper was dirty you KN you knew what to do so in a way then we're all natural born sellers
and we have to tap back into the energy and maybe set a different example of what it means to sell so that the world doesn't feel like it's so icky and gross and before I continue on I have a little confession to make I'm not a sales trainer I'm not a sales expert I haven't received any formal sales trending in fact I used to hate selling I hated it and I want to do something here I I want to dispel this this idea that's been perpetuated throughout design schools
in that if your work is good enough you won't need to sell how many people have heard this how many people have said this how many people believe this because there's a lot of you out there so what happens is if we believe this then we never acquire the skills that we need to acquire to flourish as a business to have a conversation with business owners and will always be regulated to the person who works on the box nothing wrong with that I think there's a lot to love about that but that should be by choice not by default
so I'm going to tell you in a little bit about how I shifted away from hating cells to actually loving it and feeling really good about it and I'm I'm a bit of a sales nerd and I only use the word nerd because it allows me to steal a joke from Don McMillan and I'll share it with you Don McMillan is a really a true nerd he's a comedian that uses graphs and vend diagrams so I'm going to show it to you right now right so he says that to be order to be considered a nerd you have to have three things you have to be really smart
you have to know what you're talking about okay to be a nerd you have to be socially awkward I see all of you okay we'll just look down at each other it's all good and you have to be really obsessed about certain things that's what is required to be a nerd and I am a sales nerd okay so then he asked this questions like what if you're really smart and obsessed what does that make you that makes you a a geek and what if you're really smart and you're socially awkward well that would just make you a dork
so you know we can all figure out who's who in this room in a little bit okay so then the big question is what if you're obsessed and socially awkward that would just make you a stalker see how he makes use of this beautiful diagram so this is kind of where we all net out you'll have to figure out whether you're nerd geek dork or a stalker it's okay if you are one or the other I won't judge you so then you might be sitting there asking yourself well if he doesn't know anything he's not an expert he's not been trained why am I here teaching you or talking about sales well because I think it's a critical skill for
for you to have that's going to take you to the next level and My Story begins here it's like I started my design firm in 1995 and in 2002 something seismic changes my life everything is different from this point I meet my first and only business coach he since passed away his name is Kier McLaren and Kier asked me about my sales process and to give you some context back when I was working I'm like five uh six years into my business at this point and I'm getting
to a certain point and I'm feeling really good about how it is that I I'm able to do what I do so he's like so what's the problem then I said here I feel like I'm hitting a financial ceiling that every job where we bid above $200,000 our win rate drops down to about one in every five jobs it was horrible because it was extremely demoralizing I just felt like I was throwing stuff at the wall and nothing was working and it was just really bad for the morale for the team and everybody and it turns out I had been
been doing everything wrong everything wrong and I was just like shocked when he told me Chris how this is how you've learned how to do sales yeah because no one ever taught me so here's the big lesson that I learned he said that when you get to a certain level in your life and you're working on projects north of $200,000 you have to understand something the clients can hire anybody in the entire world they can literally hire anybody from the UK from Canada from
Asia so your level of competition has completely changed you know that right I'm said no I didn't so he said you're using a minor league strategy to play in the Major League I was like whoa I oh my gosh okay so it's counterintuitive that if you just keep doing what you're doing today that you'll just keep growing but eventually you'll hit a ceiling or a wall so what you what got you here won't get you there so I needed to learn something totally different
and what he taught me allowed me to double my business in one year so in 2002 we're doing 2 million plus in Revenue gross revenue not in profit and this is what it looks like here so we're doing about $2.2 million and in course of one year I think it was three conversations three coaching sessions I had with Kier that allowed us to almost double our Revenue to $3.9 million never look back it increased our close rate from 20% to 75%
to a point in which I felt like I there's no job I cannot close if it's a legitimate buyer who has a need and a problem and they're legitimate considering multiple options put me on a call with them I would close that job so I'm going to circle back now I'm going to tell you five stories and hopefully you'll get some you there will be some learnings here for you number one is OES OES is this amazing fishing lodge on the other side of Canada it's on the West Central Coast of Canada and I went there and it's this beautiful thing you fly in this remote fish
fing location where there's more trees than people and all of civilization disappears and it's wonderful thing I love to do this and I meet the general manager that's him his his name is Ernie I like to think of him as a Canadian Crocodile Dundee complete with a Bowe knife it's the knife is right there behind his hand by the way okay and this is where you spend all this time and towards the end of our trip it's like a 4-day fishing trip where we literally live on that Lodge never touch feet on ground again for 4 days one of my fishing buddies somebody had
just met a guy named Jeff says Chris with all that you know how to do with design and marketing and all that you know how to do I bet you Oles could really use you right now I'm like yeah he goes did you ever think about talking to them and this is me pre-learning how to do sales I'm like yeah but I don't know what to say he goes yeah I'm gonna go talk to him I'm going to get you the gig and we'll work together and so he goes into the lodge it's the last day we're waiting for our plane to come in he goes into the lodge he sits down I can
can only see from the outside very much like the introvert way to do things looking through the window I'm like what is he doing they talk there's some nodding I'm like oh shoot and I started to get upset at myself I like if I had the courage and the skills I wouldn't have to have Jeffrey go in there and talk to Ernie for me so that he can take most of the money and pay me something is that can you touch a sore spot here everybody so he comes out he looks at me I'm like and he's like and what I'm like and so did you get it he goes no what did he say
he goes I didn't know how to ask him I'm like some people all talk right okay so here's the thing I went back into that room and I sat down with Ernie and I knew time is drawing close here because I I feel like the engine of the airplanes come I could hear it roaring in the distance I'm like shoot now's your moment this is it so I asked Ernie something he said Ernie I love being here this is an incredible place you must be booked solid all the time
and then Ernie pauses and he looks at me he goes actually that's not the case our season's getting shorter season getting shorter because it's not fishable he goes no because there are fewer people booking fishing trips and he told me something he says our clientele are literally dying CU they're all older and eventually they die and they don't have a way to attract young people so they can't replenish their clientele and then this is I saw an opening and it was like the skies had parted my gosh a wonderful place
I love it and they're getting fewer and fewer clients so I told Ernie this thing I said Ernie I don't know if you know this but in the outside world the real world I work in marketing and design I would love to help you does this warrant an additional conversation he goes Chris I'd love to talk to you so we exchanged information and eventually a year later I wind up doing a bunch of projects for them including a video marketing ads everything so the learning from this story is that you have to have
the courage just to ask you have to have a conversation with a person and that's all it is just to have a conversation to find out something that they want help with there's the current state our seasons are getting shorter clients are literally dying so I don't know what to do I've done too many things and nothing seems to be working and once you find that paino you can ask for an additional meeting or for the sale make sense if you're enjoying this video I just want to ask you to hit like make a comment and possibly
hit subscribe so what I would love for you to do tonight tomorrow whatever it is that you have an opportunity to learn to ask questions with the intention of just learning about what it is that somebody's trying to accomplish and find out what is holding them back it could be a mental state it could be a tool or resource and just try to serve them to get in the practice of learning how to do sales the correct way and you need to do this in practice before you actually stand in front of a real client because when you stand in front of a real client you have all the The Habit
you've had and you'll try to pitch and sell and you'll forget everything we talked about today is that clear okay please try to do that and you'll start to see there's a whole new way of doing this and all of a sudden you'll start to become the most interesting person to the person you're talking to because you know what people love they love attention it's all about me so give them more attention and see what happens so don't pitch and don't sell Story number two have you guys read this book The win without pitching Manifesto if you haven't I
highly encourage that you go pick up a copy of this book today I'm not affiliated with Blair ends in any way I've helped him sell lots of books he's Canadian as well read the book study the book then act on the book so I had this idea since there are 12 proclamations these manifestos that Blair has written I asked him on a social media audio room called Clubhouse hey why don't we do 12 nights of the win without pitching Manifesto each night we'll deconstruct one of the manifestos right
he's like that's a lot of nights Chris I'm like you want to do this or no so we wind up doing these calls just out of curiosity was anybody in Clubhouse Live for any one of those calls okay there's like seven or eight people in there cool that's kind of the fate of Clubhouse anyways it's all right okay so with Blair what happening what was happening was he was describing a bunch of different things and we went into this roleplay mode where we asked people to pitch to a sales expert and Blair is kind of dry and a little cantankerous so I knew this is
going to be this is comedy gold here as you get a bunch of awkward designers trying to pitch blare something and they tried and burned each and every single one of them and you know what I did in conversation I turned to Blair virtually and said hey Blair you know I noticed something I love the design of your books you use Mrs EES it's like this cloth covered book it feels so everything's so well designed and I've seen some of your presentations it feels different to me are you happy with the way that
going he goes no what about the printed materials that support your workshops are you have he's like no I said is this a problem you'd like to have Sol because I think I might know people to help you he goes absolutely now my friends who were on the call knew exactly what was happening because they're signaling to me in the DM like dude you're selling him right now aren't you I'm like yes but don't say anything and Blair did not even know I was just pretending he was ready to buy a service for me and then what happened was we would end the conversation I told him and he he laughed he go
see that's what sales sounds like it sounds like a conversation between two friends and that's what it's supposed to be like so what you want to do in a sales conversation is you want to manufacture problems you want to find something that already really care about so it was an observation notice I Ed neutral language lots of open-ended questions because I didn't want to lead him anywhere I didn't say I've seen your marketing materials and they suck I just said I noticed a difference between what I love and what you're doing now so I know many of you might do this especially if you're a little bit more
aggressive you sliping the DMS and say hey look at your website I'm a big fan it sucks you want to hire me no you you're rude I'm just going to delete that and block you right now so when you have this conversation hopefully a problem surfaces that you can help them with and you can flow really seamlessly into a solution and propose something selling is conversational Story number three this is not what he really looks like but he looks a lot like this person if you know who I'm talking about you'll know in a second
so I'm friends with a graphic designer who's turned into a fitness coach kind of looks like this okay and I noticed something he shifted his career from designing logos to just working out and he's very fit six-pack eight pack abs the whole bit and I noticed something he posted something on social media and says hey I have a resource that I want to give to three people if you need help with getting fit I was like I know you so I reached out to him on Facebook like hey I'm interested I need some help
and then he dm'd me right back and he said are you serious or just curious yeah I'm really serious I'm trying to get that six-pack app I don't know if it's possible but I am really serious okay so he then scheduled a call with me and I was a little surprised because I thought I was going to get a free resource of what he said and I didn't know it but I stepped into a sales funnel and those of you who are hearing this story are like dude I could see it a mile away well to me I didn't cuz it felt conversational between two
friends so we get on the phone we do a zoom call and he asked me why is getting fit really important to you I said well I need energy I want to be a positive role model for my kids and I'm vain I want to look good in the clothes that I have I'm just telling you the truth he goes okay well so he gets into this whole thing and he's he asked me one more question on a scale of 1 to 10 how important is getting fit to you I said it's eight and here's the thing that he did that
wasn't I wasn't expecting he goes why is the score not lower why is it not a six or five I said well I I I just told you it's really important I believe in action and I want to make sure my kids have a positive role model to follow and I want to be able to do this for a really long time I'm 51 years old and I want to do this for another 10 years at least I know my energy is related to how fit I feel notice what he just did there he
asked me to tell him what's important to me and he made me prove to him how important it was by asking me why isn't the score lower Tony Robbins talks about this is the the number one driving character or behavior for people is the need to be consistent with ourselves he didn't sell me anything he just kept asking me why is this so important why not do something else and you got into the emotional part of it not the
the datadriven part because he also knows that people buy based on emotions not on facts so by asking the right questions the clients will sell themselves this is what I mean to sell without being salesy it's the art of having conversation and asking big beautiful wonderful questions in service of other people Story number four is Carrie that's not her real name Carrie called me in a panic she goes Chris I'm just really tired and
frustrated at what's happening and she told me that there was another designer who was in the same coaching Community as her who is ripping off her website her language and talking about doing brand strategy and every time she gets a conversation with a prospect what happens is she's underbid every single time at less than half of what she's proposing and she didn't know what else to do and it really affected her she was the primary bread winner for her family okay so they said krie
if you see the problem more than once whose fault is it is it their fault or is it your fault if you see the problem more than once well of course it's her fault she hadn't changed her game at all so I gave her some clear instructions I said you know what I want you to do I want you to raise the objection first at the start of the call if you know every single time it's going to be about money say this before we get started I just want to let you know I'm most likely going to be the highest person who's going to bid on this
is your primary decision based on how cheap it is or based on price and so I told her to do something flip the conversation take the power back tell the person they should talk to other people first and if they find out what they need there's no need to have this conversation with you at all and I said but before you let them go I want you to educate the client about what to look for what are the warning signs that somebody doesn't know what they're talking about she goes oh I could do that I said yeah
yeah it's called Throwing Shade on your competition duh come on and then you end it with this super powerful move and say call me only if you don't feel fully confident in the options that you have here's the crazy thing Carrie gets a lot of sales calls so she got someone who called The Very NE this very same day and then she calls me back the next day she goes Chris you won't believe what happened I'm like what I did what you told me to do and they're not calling me back I'm like so
what's a surprise I said just wait it out it may not work out who knows and then surprise surprise couple days later the same client reaches out and says you know what I asked them the questions they didn't give me good answers I don't feel good about this let's talk and in making this one change Carrie then went on for the next year to double her revenue and she said I've made more money in four four or five months than I have all of last year doing this one thing so sadly car and I stopped talking you're just too busy with work
go figure okay last story I want to share with you is the most perfect sales pitch I've ever heard in my life and I want to share it with you okay all right so we usually work with sales reps and we wanted to try something different and this person I've never talked to would get on the phone and he goes Chris do you know what we do I'm like no he says can I have a few minutes to tell you what we do I'm like sure sure go ahead he goes what we do is
we take away the pain point of what you're feeling let me make a wild guess here when you work with sales reps it takes too long to see results it could take three or four months before you find out if you're going to get any new leads and the way that sales reps work traditionally is they knock on doors they make calls you have no idea what they're doing how they're doing all you do is get a bill every month for the money that they're spending and you're paying them the retainer and then if you don't like what you get with them you have to start over and you're going to burn another
another three months so what is this really costing you I'm like wow this was incredible and I don't know what he said after that but all I knew is we hired him because he spoke to me he touched on my pain points it felt like he was looking into my soul and this is the tool that you can use without getting into too much of the Gory details so if you can identify the top three pain points your clients have all the time try this one technique bring it up at the beginning
say something like this whenever I speak to customers or clients just like you they usually tell me their top three biggest problems are and then fill in the blanks just try it and see what happens okay now what you want to do is if you don't have enough data don't do this if you've been in business for some time and you keep hearing certain things then then you can do it so don't guess be specific and if you're able to nail this it's an instant credibility Builder and then when you're done saying it ask this one question
is that right and what you're looking for is that's right okay so a couple things you can do to prepare for this next sales call so here are things you may want to take a photograph of this you don't need to but ask yourself this question what pain does your client experience that's functional Financial or emotional just Workshop it with yourself you need to figure this stuff out and you should if you've been in business long enough you will know the answer to this question number two what negative outcomes are your clients fearful of or trying
to avoid number three this is the important one what objections or accusations might new clients raise with you most likely they're going to raise issues about experience um vertical expertise about price probably about timeline and about the size of your team it's usually one of those five things so what you want to do is you want to write them down and you want to start thinking about what the answer is going to be prepare for this so here's a quick reminder sales is
is not convincing it's not persuading it's not manipulation selling is helping it's about being curious selling is learning selling is an act to generosity so that's a lot to remember in process so serve ask listen empathize and summarize I just want you to focus on the two key skills you don't need to know anything else if you can do the these two asking and listening listening you'll nail this thing so focus on these two things to me when you ask a really good question it's like magic you open the
s's mind and there's a great book I don't know if you read it it's called the coaching habit and there's a framework in there that Michael bung here talks about I'll share the questions with you but I didn't realize this is an amazing sales coaching book it's not it's about something else but in it as I read it I'm like that's how I sell this is perfect number one he says be slower to give advice ask more questions be curious longer and here are the six or seven questions that he has
and the ones that I highlighted for you is what's on your mind and then you keep asking and what else and what else and then you ask and what's the real challenge for you on a sales training call I did with my uh my group I literally just read the script and I didn't even respond to anything the other person said I just literally went down the list and like that was amazing Chris I'm like thank you I just read a script here's a script you can use it too it works so if you're terrible just literally read the script okay the next thing you need to know is if you ask
because you don't listen the question is worthless and people do this all the time and you they'll do this later today with you they'll ask you a question about what how your life is going and then their eyes will be somewhere else they don't really care so you have to listen they're twins asking and listening so you want to do this thing that Kevin Dy talks about it's called Full value listening full value listening is whatever the other person says is the most important thing you've ever heard you have to listen with great attention to detail with what they're saying and to feel
what they're feeling the mistake that I'm talking about here is when you ask a question they give you an answer the very next question should be a followup to the answer they gave you that's how you know you're listening and I see this happen all the time somebody asks a question you get an answer and then just ask a totally different question unrelated to the first question because then you feel like oh I think you're reading a script right now and unfortunately this is how most podcasters interview people they have 75 questions they literally just go from question to question and when they do this to me I'm bored out of my mind
okay so there's a stack here you start with the current state when you're when you're listening like what what is going on right now in their life okay cool I get that what is the desired future state where would they like to go what kind of transformation what kind of result what kind of change do they want and what is standing in their way how would they measure success what is valuable to them if you can find out what this is you're going to do a great job at it and then when you hear all these things you're going to process it you're going to do something that
Kevin refers to is playing back and summarizing and it's very important that you use the same words that they use if they say I'm really fatigued with this thing don't say you're really tired say fatigued you're using exact same language because language is important and it matters you change the word you change the meaning of it and then when you summarize all of this stuff you say did I miss anything is this correct it's an opportunity for you to learn new information and then nope I think you got it all here's how you close
the sale you ask a hypothetical question we all love H asking hypo hypothetical questions an if then question so what I heard you say was blah blah BL blah so if you saw a solution that did this this and that in this time for this amount of money then you would be willing to move forward and you're waiting for an emphatic yes not a pregnant pause not a strained yes an emphatic yes when you get the emphatic yes you say I'll have a proposal to you by end of business
day today I'll follow up with you tomorrow is that okay so you've gone through the problem you talked about the price you've gotten verbal agreement from them that this is how they want to move forward and you won't realize how powerful this is in terms of them committing to their own words and ideas that's the secret so I found this quote from Jeffrey gmer don't tell your customers something they don't know about you tell them something they don't know about them that's
a big unlock asking great questions will give you an unfair legal competitive Advantage if you make a practice of this you'll start to see your close ratio go up the budgets go up and your friction go down so here's some quick here's some resources for you people always ask for the book list there it is take a picture and I have a little scorecard for you and then I'm going to get off stage I can't believe I did this on time here we go here's your question scorecard every time you advise
talk make an assumption you're ambiguous with your questions and you're being too assertive with your tone take away a point this is how you decrease trust and Goodwill and how you kill Rapport every time you ask a big beautiful smart specific question every time you listen intently and play back what you've heard every time you ask a question that is full of curiosity that's focused on the client's needs and not yours every time you're ask a clear question and you use the the late night FM DJ voice
you get a point I don't have an FM DJ voice I'm horse it's cold I'm sorry thank you very much everybody that's my time we got time we have time for some questions yeah we have two minutes um folks you can send in some questions for Chris type quickly if you head to Instagram in the stories there's a question box but I have one already which is amazing so someone was fast what is a mistake that you've
learned from when it comes from selling turning this on you I I'll tell you before I learned how to sell I did something terrible I thought it was my job to tell the clients what I think they should have and it did this amount own detriment so I'd get on the phone they would describe the brief and I'd start immediately pitching ideas we could do this we could shoot it with this camera and use these lenses and sequence it this way and like thanks they hang out the phone and I'm like I don't know why they never called me back I don't know what happened so it's making a lot of assumption
and not being curious that's the biggest mistake do you sometimes think think that clients do need you to tell them what to do though I'm thinking about my own experiences yeah eventually but I try to make it as painful as possible for them for them to do all the talking and I will tell them this when I first learned how to ask these questions and the big sales unlock mystery thing it was like wow I tell them I'm going to talk to you I'm going to ask you lots of questions and it might be really uncomfortable but it's important for me to understand what your needs are What in
inspires you what a win looks like where it's failed where you've succeeded so I can give you a solution that is tailored for you and they accept that so a 30- minute call turns into a 90-minute call and we're all exhausted and you will be exhausted if you're doing this correctly but here's the here's the beautiful thing about this is you only then propose one solution so back before I learned how to do this we would pitch and we would do 17 different ideas 17 different logos three different storyboards CU we don't know we had no idea so it's just a guessing game
yeah what are you thinking about in your own business right now when it comes to selling well that's a good question I think I did my job right this is what he needed me to come out and do yeah I don't think I'm selling anymore what I do is I try to create content okay I know what it is okay here here's my strategy for selling make content so good give it all away for free as much as possible with no strings no funnels no email traps to guilt you into buying something that's it that's the secr there's a gentleman here who
working backstage he goes hey I just had to say thank you to you for my friend who literally made a million dollars watching your content I'm like tell him to send me a check a million dollars she's like literally a million dollars I haven't seen the check yet I don't know not feeling so guilty Are there specific things about selling you are thinking about though you obviously think about this a lot beyond what you've presented what are you sort of rolling around in your mind I'm trying to sell you something yeah or even just the sort of like ethos about selling has anything changed in your thinking in the last little bit not changed but it's
it continues to evolve and I think if I try to help whoever's in front of me all of you or you to the best of my ability the selling has begun it really has and here's the weird thing I'll just tell this and I realized we're out of time I just finished doing a workshop in Miami with no intention of selling them anything and all of a sudden people like I want to buy more from you like oh okay let me figure this thing out I was even trying that's that's the most beautiful part of this so if you help somebody so if I'm trying to sell you I would just really get into your whatever your business is
is and I bet you I can figure something out with you and tell you something you didn't know and to that you'll start to feel an emotional connection with me right now I feel like it's a challenge I'm not doing it right my f DJ voice all right folks give it up for Chris one more time thank you












the reason why I'm a good salesperson because I care more about what they want and what I want to hear it I care more if it's a good fit for them than it is for me
I hold the clients in high esteem know what it is that my agenda is that's it my question was about you know to reach this success how do I know I'm delivering the value that will create my success so here's how I wrote it down hopefully this is I wanted to be an emphatic yes otherwise you just keep practically I try to use as many of the original words you use as possible so you say how do I know I can deliver value relative to the price I'm charging so what you ask for no no I think it's over I think it's a really I think it's a really simple answer wait I want to understand the question okay Henry diagnose subscribe write write write but I know exactly I could I get okay then
let's say the question results that you clients get that's the answer so you get one good result and you're like okay next time I can double my price not necessarily no but you got to leverage your clients results you have to take those results and say hey look at what Priscilla has done for me and my business does that answer the question in some ways yes
wait wait wait we need to find a home let me say something I need to help you guys with this I know everybody here's a thousand smart answers I know that I know you guys have a thousand smart answers I know Google Ads 2001 smart answers well here's the thing I I don't know if I have clarity of the question and yet they're like a thousand sharks and there's no ready to jump on the answer I don't know and I don't like guessing because here's the thing you know how hard it is to give advice that somebody actually apply it's very difficult there's a business owner that's in front of you that has been very successful doing everything they've done to get to this point in their life you need to understand that you never respect that they are the lion you are the Sheep you need to understand that you don't go into the line until the line how to eat it doesn't work like that
what you have to do is you have to understand their lens their point of view their value system how they're gonna judge success and you get them to think you're just trying to help them to think so if you ask them questions now people are upset at me like you didn't say anything but you gave me the best answer like well how'd that work because I'm just gonna ask you questions until you answer in the way need to hear it because your voice your advice is the best advice that you're gonna take this is the technique guys this is not just by accident that I do this all the time so if I'm smart enough we have enough time eventually even with maybe the language barrier I will get Priscilla to answer on questions you're like this is amazing I want you to think of yourself as a therapist the therapist you don't just walk in like you know you have issues with your mom it's like well we don't know that now do we but when you actually spent you've spent a long time therapy you and I you know it's like we know they just ask you really super smart questions I think they already know the answer because the way they phrase the question is pointing me in a direction so when they keep asking it starts to point me it's a competing closer and then I say something but that's the power of the consultant of therapists consultative selling this is what we want to do we all everybody in this room wants to rush to the answer try guys employee to try to refrain from doing
just ask more questions get clarity help them to think they will come to the conclusion I have a question the urge to answer and help so quickly is coming from a very good place I didn't I don't know I'm not I'm not really trying to justify what what things can we apply and ask this question okay what compels you to open your mouth before we continue I want to take a brief moment to thank our sponsor of this video vixens vexos is the design platform where designers can find everything they need to boost their creative projects download from their library of over 90,000 professionally made graphics compatible with all major designer software they have an amazing team of talented illustrators and designers constantly uploading new content to their site so you'll have access to fresh content daily it doesn't matter if you're pro designer or if you're just getting started with your creative career you'll find everything you need on their site they offer tons of easy to edit business and branding templates for illustrator and Photoshop mock-ups to showcase your designs professionally so you can create logos posters and more in a flash for the more advanced designers their graphic resources are the perfect digital asset for your new creations they've got everything from backgrounds patterns characters icons and more and if you can't find something on their site you can always request custom designs and their team of designers will create it for you to download

well compels you to speak to fill the gap what compels you to speak all the time me personally yeah I'm talking to you I don't like science put a silenced equal to you not me boredom
people aren't enjoying themselves why do you feel the need to entertain people to make everybody enjoy themselves that's just a just an intrinsic need of my own like I feel happy when other people are happy and I'm ensuring that other people are happy do you think some people enjoy silence that are happy in silence I do like who do you know that enjoy silence you like Roxy like you said there's a lot of people enjoy science so do you think it's important for you to use one value system on the meaning of silence versus looking at what the person wants I I get that okay I get that Henry gets that but Henry could not stop himself from being like you're I I tried to learn it but you're not gonna be here all the time for us right right well I'm trying to ask you a lot of questions helps you get to the same point oh okay i sir do you understand that yeah okay now I think we are all looking for validation that's my opinion and we're trying to validate that we're smart that we have answers and we can't wait to prove it to another human being like I have the answers and I'll tell you stories about how that cost us lots of money okay when we're on a call with a client you try to cut them up you try to finish the sentence you know how to really love the color purple no you don't really love about this campaign are design you see what I'm saying it's like after a while it's like why are you the idiot in the room right so you know what I do and there's a darker side to the air when we get on these conference calls it's almost always audio only and I'm sitting in the room with a bunch of creative directors trying to win you know six-figure jobs so the minute somebody cuts off the client I give them the death eyes like don't do that why this is value you cutting them off says I don't need any more information why
because you're desperate to prove you know what they're gonna say then why would you do that so soon as waking up with a phone I'm gonna go around the room like what did we do wrong don't cut off the call yet don't assume experts do not assume closing small jobs closing big jobs just takes divided so slow it down you'll see what happens something radical will trip okay
Melinda are working on a bunch of new whiteboard series things to help you guys out but this is weird paradox if you want to be seen as smart and as an expert don't say anything just be quiet
how can we train ourselves better actually connects that question how have you trained yourself to embrace that when the feeling to speak up and to say something is just so powerful like I could see his nonverbals like you were like you know so I want to get tactical I believe it I believe in it and sometimes I'm weak in the moment I'm class of five okay
just kind of fly
Henry count to 20 that's kind of slow like 1/1000 slow down look here's the thing guys I say this and I know it's gonna sound like I'm bragging I'm not bragging the reason why I'm a good salesperson because I care more about what they want then what I want
period
I care more if it's a good fit for them than it is for me
I hold the client and hire steam than what it is that my agenda is that's it and you know what happens then when you stop selling you start closing more it's the paradox like everything that you think to be true in in these sales situations it's the opposite of what you think I'm telling you guys right now everybody in this room the next time you go on a client call sit there and think how could it be a better service to this person tell me if you had to choose between five different vendors one person sold one person pitch one person cuts you off on person
guess the only other person that didn't do that stop there and listen to everything you said like every word you said mattered who you gonna give the job to all things being equal Oh got it up now all things not being equal it's still a good chance that that last person he's the person gonna hire drink'll you want to say something right I know I see you dying over
well one Mississippi

Crafting Value-Based Project Quotes
(Saved responses are view only)
When crafting a quote, Louis Amy Engineering should strategically present numbers to emphasize value, outcomes, and transformation for the client, while explicitly avoiding detailed internal cost breakdowns or hourly rates. Chris Do's philosophy advocates for a value-based pricing model that focuses on the client's desired future state and the impact of the services, rather than the effort involved.
Here’s a breakdown of what numbers to include and how to present them, aligned with Chris Do's insights:
1. The Core Principle: Fixed, Value-Based Investment
• What to include: A single, clear "Final Contract Price" for each option offered. This fixed fee represents the total investment for the outcome and value delivered, not the sum of hours or costs.
• How to frame it: Present this as an "Investment" that secures the client's vision and delivers specific, desirable outcomes (e.g., "Your Investment for a Legacy Home," "Delivering Unparalleled Value: [Final Contract Price]").
2. Tiered Options for Perceived Value and Anchoring
• What to include: Three distinct pricing options (e.g., Option A: Full Bespoke, Option B: Collaborative Partnership, Option C: Core Architecture Only), each with its own fixed price.
    ◦ High-Value Anchor (Option A - Full Bespoke): Position the highest-priced option first, representing the maximum possible value and transformative outcome. This sets a high initial benchmark for the client's perception of value.
    ◦ Optimal Value (Option B - Collaborative Partnership): This would be your firm's "Louis Amy Price," representing the ideal blend of expertise and value, typically slightly below the highest anchor.
    ◦ Contextual Contrast (Option C - Core Architecture Only): This is the lowest-scope, lowest-priced option, serving to make the mid- and high-tier options appear more attractive and to highlight the value of services excluded.
• How to frame it: Clearly delineate the scope and unique benefits of each option. For the lowest tier, subtly highlight the increased client responsibility or potential challenges due to the reduced scope, which implicitly encourages moving to higher-value options.
3. Strategic Comparison Points (Controlled Transparency)
• What to include:
    ◦ Market Rate: Display the "Industry Standard" or "Market Rate" as a benchmark.
    ◦ Louis Amy Price (Internal Benchmark): Include your firm's calculated "In-House Expertise" price.
• How to frame it: Use these as secondary points to validate Louis Amy Engineering's premium positioning and to demonstrate that even with superior service, your firm offers "exceptional value". The emphasis should not be on "Total Savings" as a discount, but rather on the value delivered at the "Final Contract Price" relative to these benchmarks.
4. Construction Budget Overview
• What to include:
    ◦ Total Project Budget: The estimated overall budget for the construction project.
    ◦ Budget Distribution: High-level percentages and dollar amounts allocated to major categories like "Shell Budget," "Interior Budget," and "Landscape Budget".
• How to frame it: Present this information visually (e.g., using interactive donut charts) to provide clear context for the design fees and demonstrate thoughtful financial planning. This shows the client where their total construction investment is focused.
5. Design Services Distribution (Value-Oriented)
• What to include: A breakdown of the design fee by major service categories (e.g., Scan to BIM, Building Shell, Interior, Landscape), indicating percentages and associated dollar amounts. This focuses on the different disciplines involved.
• How to frame it: This distribution should highlight the integrated nature of Louis Amy Engineering's services and how each component contributes to the holistic design and successful outcome. This is an opportunity to show the scope of professional expertise without detailing internal costs.
6. Supplemental Services (as Priced Add-ons)
• What to include: For services like specialized engineering (e.g., Geotechnical) or advanced visualization, present these as separate, fixed-fee "add-ons".
• How to frame it: Frame these as opportunities to elevate the project or mitigate further risks, linking them to specific benefits rather than just costs. Avoid "Cost + 15% Fee" language and explicit hourly tables. Instead, bundle consultant costs with Louis Amy's coordination fee into a single, value-based fixed price for the supplemental service.
Explicit Exclusions (Crucial for Value-Based Pricing)
Do NOT include the following in client-facing proposals:
• Hourly Rates: No "Hourly Fee Table" or mentions of average hourly rates. Chris Do vehemently argues that hourly billing measures effort, not value, and punishes efficiency.
• Hours Breakdowns: Remove "Project Phases & Hours Distribution" and "Fee Analysis" by hours or individual team members. This exposes internal processes and invites clients to negotiate based on time, not value.
• Internal Calculations: Do not show how a price is derived by subtracting internal costs (e.g., "Calculated as Option A minus Interiors authoring...") [Query]. This devalues services and encourages unbundling based on perceived cost, not value.
• Detailed Profit Margins: Avoid disclosing internal profit margins.
By adhering to these principles, Louis Amy Engineering can present quotes that resonate with clients by focusing on the value, outcomes, and peace of mind they are purchasing, rather than the effort or cost.
Next Step Suggestion: Review your current proposal documents and identify all instances where internal financial mechanics (like hourly rates or detailed hour breakdowns) are exposed. Prioritize their removal and replacement with value-oriented language and fixed pricing for services and add-ons.

it's the purpose that keeps me in a movie in a specific direction and is connected to my passion and when those two work together in concert you can go really far baby what's up people you're listening to a quick read an advertising podcast that talks book smarts and street smarts with the people who have been there done that today's guest is chris doe founder and ceo of the future and brand strategy design consultancy blind he flips the script with marty newmeier's the brand flip while teaching 1 billion people how to make a living doing what they love you know what to do tune in and turn up what's up my man chris how you doing i'm doing great brandon good talking to you awesome man i'm so i'm so excited you're you're on the show obviously you're out there you're all over the internets man no matter where you look you're out there you got videos tutorials podcasts you're trying to reach a billion people and change their lives right is that the thing that is right so you got to be everywhere if you want to try to reach a billion people absolutely well i'm excited to have you on the show today and uh and you picked a really great book so you went you went with the brand flip by marty neumeyer why'd you pick that book for for the show today well i wanted to make sure i had a book that i was familiar enough that i can talk to you off the cuff and i've been a big fan of marty neumeyer he's written several books and i had to just pick one so this is the one that i think it's a good summary overview of all the books he's written before including the brand gap the design for company and zag yeah no definitely brand gap i thought was awesome i remember reading that years ago uh but before we jump into sort of the conversation and hear your journey and sort of design and advertising let's let's kind of get up to speed what is the what's the back story here did you kind of wake up one day and and graduate high school or whatever and say man i'm going to go into design and advertising or did you come about it a different way you know what it's not that different than what you just described i was prepared to do something very different something very technical maybe in computer science or some some engineering thing and then i got this really awkward opportunity to go and work at a silk screening shop and that's when i was introduced to the world of professional designers because prior to that point in time i thought design was a bunch of starving artists and that one decision to go and work for this man named brad shaboya introduced me to a whole nother world and ultimately is why i landed up in at art center and then working in design and advertising wow that's cool so at that point you you kind of you know your journey began now did you you went to um did you go to design school before that or was that after that moment no that was in high school and then i went to i went to community college for a year and then i got my portfolio together got into art center and then graduated with a bachelor's in graphic design packaging excellent excellent and then from there did you do any time at any like more traditional agencies or have you always kind of you know been more on the freelance side and then obviously you know you've been building your your empire now so uh but before that did you did you do any stints with any more traditional agencies i did right before i graduated a friend of mine colleen mathis got a job at cole weber an ad agency in seattle and she encouraged me to apply and i set my portfolio in and to my surprise and delight i was offered a job now keep in mind this is before i graduated so i'm i decided to take a semester off i work in advertising and was offered a job and thought at that point my life was set i was going to finish school and fly back and forth between school and the agency and ultimately it wasn't a perfect fit for me i had spent my four years at art center trying to be the best designer i can be and in advertising less is more and i understand why it's not supposed to be about all the different layers of design that you can put in there it's about the messaging and the concept and so i didn't feel like i was being fully utilized in the way that i knew how to to create yeah now when you were early in your career were you working on like brand work were you you know what kind of work were you kind of starting out on well one once i decided that wasn't right for me i finished school and i started off on my own i started freelancing around town getting whatever kind of gig i can get and so naturally the exposure level which you're going to have is like very small clients mostly editorial post-production facilities here in los angeles and that's what i was doing and i decided to really quickly focus in on doing motion design and working for big ad advertising agencies making commercials gotcha gotcha now one of the big ideas from the book the first one that we kind of highlight is this idea that people no longer buy into brands they join them so when you think about that that thought you know how how's that playing out in your career how has that been something that you've seen evolved from maybe even the earliest days till till now well in terms of my career i made a lot of commercials in my life i had worked in advertising on the vendor side and was running my company for 20 plus years and so i wasn't really involved in the strategic level thinking we got a brief we would write treatments and then either win or not win the job and then produce these commercials and for a long time i thought that was just how far i was going to go in my life in terms of my proximity to a to a client but towards the latter part of my company i started to work with clients directly mostly out of intrigue and some necessity because we saw that the the tides were shifting away from the kind of commercials that we made so i started to develop relationships with clients and doing direct direct marketing and started to understand all the things that agencies do which is understand who the customers are the unique selling proposition and to build a relationship and that's when i had to dig deeper to understand branding and what branding is and so for a lot of people especially people in myspace they think branding is about the way things look or they think it's one aspect or the other when it's actually the totality of all the experiences that a customer comes in contact with and so you think about the things that you buy and we're talking about things that are outside of the commodities where there's an equal replacement so you just buy the cheapest thing but anything beyond that it's really about you joining a tribe and you defining who you are your own identity when you buy the things that you do and that is really intriguing to me it made me very self-conscious then all of a sudden like why do i prefer this watch over that one or this computer or this car over the other because it's really about my identity and how closely i align with the values and principles of the companies and the brands that make the products i love yeah and so at this point in your journey when you started to really dig a little deeper into brands and working with brands and helping them sort of understand how they could get people to join their brands is this the point is this the moment where you decided i want i want to help teach other people how to do this or or have we not gotten that far in the store yet it's pretty close um there was a couple of years of me doing brand strategy doing client direct work but you know i just kept thinking to myself i used to work for agencies now i work for clients direct and somewhere in between and it's just changing whoever it is that signs your ticket at the end of the day and i started to think about like what's my life going to be like after all this like is my entire life meant to do client service work and i thought there was something more it just so happened that around the same time as i'm exploring client direct work that i run into an old friend of mine from school his name is jose caballer and he started introducing me to ux design principles and with the other thing he wanted me to do was to make videos with him and as a person who is a behind the camera talent not in front of the camera it was some one of those things where i'm like no you do that i don't want to do this but he insisted and he was a very difficult person to say no to and so that's how i reluctantly began making videos and i want to just state this for everyone listening this is in 2014 i'm 42 years old at this point so i'm not like a young person like thinking oh the internet's everything social media is something i did not understand i thought it was very vacuous and something that people did to show off what they do yeah and so you started you know the blind was was started well before right so 1995 and then so you were working like you were grinding for a minute like you were really putting in the work before you decided to launch what now has become your you know your megaphone with the future is that correct that's right so i've been in business now since 1995 so in 2014 that's like 20 on 19 years right that's it's getting up there so we've been doing this for a long time and i thought at first why would i want to make content on youtube this is where amateurs hang out this is where people have a lot more free time than actual work and so i didn't want to be associated with that and that's just my own prejudice and short-sightedness and what i what i found quickly is that a person like myself with actual real experience working with clients doing national and international work with fortune 100 companies there's a place here for me and i can create content and i can help people i can help people at all stages in their lives many self-taught many are looking for another thing to get inspired and youtube happens to be a wonderful place where we can all come together as the watering hole and just share what what it is that we do that's really cool and you know that brings us to you know the second big idea in the book this idea that people are not focused on products but meaning if i buy this product what does that make me and it sounds like you know we were having a little bit of that conversation of you discovering okay what does that mean if i'm on youtube doing these videos you know when do you think about yourself as a product you know i mean in a way you are i mean you've you've your face is everywhere everyone knows who you are i know clearly all freelancers are you know follow your content you're really building this great brand that's super helpful for people to really monetize their brands and how to build their their sort of careers um do those questions come into play you know for you where like okay what is my brand you know what is the meaning like and you know do you think about that you know in a different way since you kind of are the product yeah absolutely so for many many many years what i did was i worked for other brands other products other companies and did the best that i could to suppress my own biases and i don't want to inject whatever it is that i'm doing into their their brand because they have a right to do the things that feel right to them and so it's never been a concern of mine and in fact i just hid behind the wall of the company as blind as a service provider there were many of us it wasn't just me and i didn't want my voice to be more dominant than anyone else's voice and and so as such it's like i just kind of did what everybody else did i'm going to do the work i'm going to show up i'm going to do great customer service and that's as much as i can do and then you step in front of the camera all of a sudden you have to become really aware of who you are and how you're projecting your energy because people don't connect with the content they connect with the person who delivers the content i'm a big believer in this there aren't a whole lot of original ideas out there they're just repackaged and recontextualized for the person and for the time and the audience and so my business partner at that time jose the one who lured me into making content youtube we kind of looked at each other and like we're so different we're so opposite and you know he's uh puerto rican and he's loud and self-described obnoxious extrovert i'm the analytical uh quiet reserved asian guy and so we thought hey man you remember this whole tv series called the odd couple that's us we're the odd couple felix's an oscar and so i'm gonna come to set with the suit and tie i like wearing suits and ties i don't have many occasions to wear them so i like getting dressed up and and showing up and i said jose why don't you come in a tunic like with beads from venice and like be all hippyish and and earthy and he's like perfect that's who i am like burning man versus the suit and that's how we played and that became our character and that's what people got to know us as and so there was some um deliberate uh impression management if you will we wanted to draw the contrast between our two styles or different experiences and it was it was a good chemistry and it played well on air until it didn't yeah so when we go back to that question if i buy this product what does that make me what do you think or how do you think your audience views themselves when they say oh you know you know the the people who follow the future and and the brands that you're uh that you're a part of how do you think they view themselves or how do you want them to view themselves yes i think any any brand's ability to connect with their audience you have to know who they are you have to know who they aspire to become and it's pretty clear to us as to who they are we we think they're creative people and and not under the traditional definitions of creative it's like i forget his name but um it's a herbert simon the the nobel writer he talked about like design or creativity as a person who invents a preferred solution over an existing one or a preferred scenario or something like that and so that's what we think of as a person is creative so if there's an accounting problem and you invent a preferred situation then you're a creative person in my mind you're a designer and so we we have a broad blanket definition of who a creative person is not traditional like i make art and and do things with pixels or paint but they're they're they've gone to school some of them have been kind of forgotten or disenfranchised by the schools that they went to they didn't go to top tier schools where something funny or funky happened their career switchers they were a repressed creative person pursued something else didn't work out in life and had decided one day i want to do this thing and they stumble into some of our content so that's really our audience it's like the disenfranchised the forgottens but they work hard and and they're honest and earnest people and that's who we want to serve they don't have access to the super expensive private art schools nor are they that interested in them we're there for them we hope to be their champion yeah that's that's such a cool point of view and and i think it ladders up to this big mission that you put out this billion dollar this billion billion well i'm sure you're on your way to a billion dollar but this billion uh person uh education mission when did you decide to declare that yeah there's a story behind that because we had this management meeting and we're sitting in the conference room and and we're still unsure of who we are i'm still doing client service work as blind and some of us are dabbling on the future but not a lot of us and all of a sudden everybody's coming on board from the server side so for the first time we had no master to please we had to set our own agenda and we kind of had to figure out what was going on so naturally there was a lot of confusion a little argument and then they asked us is this about making money or selling courses are we a workshop company what are we and they said guys step back a second here here's what i want us to think about one of my guys his name is ben it has a little daughter and she's like two years old at that time i said i like for her when she's 17 or 18 and thinking about going to college for her to be able to consider traditional art school brick and mortar or to consider the future and there would be the same tour with a vastly different price tag and when i said that you know ben who was arguing with me got really emotional he's like that's why we do what we do chris it's not for us because it's too late for all of us we can't change that and it's too late for my children because they're too old at this point we need time to build this thing up and so that night i went home and i thought like that's a long story to tell i need to figure out how to tell the story much faster so i wrote a couple lines down i sent it to ben he's like dude i love this and initially i wrote teach a billion people how to make money doing what they love but to me it's more than just the pursuit of money so that's when i change it to make a living doing what they love because a living is what you define it to be and it could be about money or it could be a satisfaction or just to know that you're you're making an impact in the world however you want to do that we want to make sure it's long-term sustainable for you and the people that are part of your responsibility wow that's so that's so awesome and you know i bet that feels good to you know to think of it that way right especially coming from an industry that sometimes feels you know sort of like um you know sometimes empty you know like i think you're sometimes you're on set or you're designing something and you're like is this really is my entire life boiling down to this you know milk carton um you know that sort of thing so to think about you know changing the future and people's livelihoods that's got to be pretty rewarding it is and i'm i have to say too i just want to for a full disclosure for everybody listening i've i've gotten to the point and achieved more than i thought i ever achieved which also means i've made more money than i thought possible and so i'm i'm financially all right and so when you get to that point in which you have to you don't have to worry anymore about your physiological needs food shelter and clothing those kinds of things what else are you going to do with your life like what what do you want your life to count for and that's really those kind of questions that i keep asking myself and so i feel like this and and this is just me being an immigrant coming from vietnam as a refugee here to this country and being able to achieve this it's time for me to stop trying to get more it's time for me to give more to figure out like somebody else here whether you're in this country you're somewhere else you're struggling to make things meet and you want to live this life and you don't want to be a disappointment to everybody that knows you and has trusted you i want to be there for them and i think it was obama quoting someone else but like when when you achieve success when you're at the top it's your obligation to send the elevator back down and that's what i need to do i want to send it back down to try to help people and that's the mission wow man i love that love hearing that and i can feel that sort of quote gut feeling that you're talking about there that's kind of the the third idea in the book that we kind of pulled out is this idea that a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or organization you can't control it but you can influence it um brand is branding's about managing impressions so you know when you think about your career you know when you think about you know whether it's you know ural's media education company or you think about the brands you've worked with um you know talk a little bit about how important that idea has been this idea of how do you tell a client how do you shape a client that the work needs to tap into that gut feeling talk a little bit about that it is tough it is really tough so if we are working with an agency we're never going to talk about that because it's not really our place to say hey this is like the tale of trying to wag the dog the the strategic directors all the people on the account side have figured that out know the brand inside and out and me as a vendor pretty late in the game here i'm not gonna go tell my clients the agencies to do that but when i'm working with client direct whether it be a mom and pop business or multi-billion dollar corporation we're trying to help them find their soul we got to go back in time and find find out what the founders were thinking what change they wanted to impact on the world and see if we tap into that story and if we can tell that story and be courageous enough to commit to it and then i think we can stand for something and stand out unfortunately a lot of people in corporations they don't want to take a stand on anything they don't want to say anything that potentially can alienate a single customer and in doing so i don't think they win the hearts and minds of anyone yeah you'll do until someone else does better and so it's it's a it's a struggle and luckily for us we get to meet clients who are looking for that we want a voice we want to know who who we are and what we stand for and and through the process of facilitation and sitting down and having strategic conversations and we we eventually come to a place where i think yeah i think we found the soul the dna of what it is that you're doing and we want to be able to help you tell that story to the world in a in a repeatable story format because that's that's how those stories spread you got to make it simple you got to make it easier for people to understand and you have to make a difference yeah well and i think that the other thing is to get clients to understand that gut feeling or that that vibe you're trying to communicate through the work you got to be able to talk about the work you know one of the things i love about a lot of your content that that i consume you know even as a as a creative director at an agency i love how you do the role plays and you break down and you really help creatives learn how to talk about the work and if you're going to sell somebody a gut feeling right you got to be able to talk about it and so talk a little bit about that i think you guys do such a good job with that content um you know for you was that something that you you've just crafted over time because you know i love you know seeing some of those role play videos of presenting the work and you know showing how i think you did a video where you guys were connecting a brand to like an old shipyard and you were you know presenting the work as sort of a role play and you were talking about the the sailor and you know the his beard and the things he wears and you know the the colors and the etchings on the crates you know seaside crates that sort of thing um i think that's really important and i think there's a lot of really great designers out there who make amazing work but really struggle to talk about it so i'd love to hear you share with them some of those things you've learned like how do you approach really presenting the work so that the end user feels that gut feeling thank you yes so i think we're all natural story consumers some of us are natural storytellers and i think back at the time in which i was much younger probably like barely 12 years old or something i remember going through my uncle's lp collection and i didn't know the bands that he was listening to from chicago to kiss this is not part of my era of music and i'm just looking at the album art thinking i wonder what the story is about these people like who are these people with lightning bolts across their face or what does this chocolate bar have to do like what is this i don't understand it and so i i made it a game i would tell my cousins hey and i don't know why i was doing this maybe trying to impress them like you know this band this is what they're about and i would tell this story and i can see in their eyes like oh my gosh this is really cool so all of a sudden this piece of art which had no meaning to them and i just bs my way through all this i just made up stories and all of us do this to some degree some of us tell little white lies some of us daydream and look at clouds and form stories and we see that we see this happening as a natural phenomenon and then you forget about this you go to school you become an adult and you forget that imagination is a vital part of your life and your happiness so for me it's about tapping into this now having to present ideas to get clients to sign off on things to win pitches you have to fill the imagination gap and what i've learned is if you if you turn the right phrase you reframe what they're looking at in ways that they cannot unsee what you told them and it could be just the the sound that birds make the fluttering of their wings and how it connects to this thing right or it could be like a really clever transition like in your sequence when you're designing it it goes from a and then before you know it through some slight of hand misdirection it becomes something different in that moment i think there's this pleasurable response it's uh in the book a smile on the mind that's what's happening you give them the puzzle you solve it together and it results in delight we're in on the joke and so when i'm presenting a logo or a mood board like the one that you're referencing i have to be able to weave a story so it transcends just being pigment on a piece of paper because that's what it is objectively speaking it's pigment on a piece of paper and so i i tell them like you know for this particular brand you're out by the sea and i'm inspired by nautical themes and we want to go away from the traditional things but here's something i've always been intrigued by the topography on sales and you know you notice because those sales the mass is very uh translucent and so sometimes the topography you see both sides the front side and the back side and as soon as i say that to the client they're like that's pretty genius and they like to be in on the joke they want to be smart and they want to know that they got it too and so if you have good clients they recognize that and they're like yeah let's go with this idea so essentially you're you're looking at multiple options but when you can tell a story that resonates with them where they feel like they're in on the joke and i'm not saying joe click is a funny thing but they're in on the trick the magic trick if you will and then they bite down on it and this can be done in very subtle ways and it can be done in very overt ways but here's one subtle thing like at now if you're if you study design you understand that there's a hidden symbol in the fedex logo but until you see it you never see it there's a little arrow that's pointing between the letter e and the letter x and it's crafted in such a way i think that's what it is maybe i got that wrong fedex yeah something like that it's in there somewhere sorry and if you look at it all of a sudden it's like yeah fedex moves things right it gets things from point a to point b and it's hidden in there and when you see that it's like it creates this little pleasurable thing to happen inside your mind i'm sure they looked at thousands of word mark letter combinations and that's when they they resolved on because a it's classic it's using futura but there's a hidden symbol and then once you see it you can't unsee it yeah no that's cool and i like what you said there you said subtle ways and overt ways i think a lot of creatives think that when they present their work they have to you know be the don draper and do the big song and dance and all that sort of thing but i think sometimes you know watching you do some of these role plays like you know you mentioned you know being more of an introvert i think you have sort of this relaxed style where you kind of just you you talk it in a in a way that's sort of you know to the point and but there's a little bit of poetry in it but it's not you know this big flashbang sort of thing so you know would you agree with that that you don't have to be this over-the-top presenter who's you know a ted talker you can you can be somewhat understated but still do a good job absolutely and if you can be that ted talker you have that gif of gab and you know how to turn a phrase be that person but there are not that many people out there like that and unfortunately people get caught in the other trap which was is to say a bunch of things and and get into this art speak theoretical thing and the that's the problem with that is people can smell bs a mile away when you have to invent things that i'm like where what are you talking about we talking the same thing here what's going on and so rather than go that route use the economy of words to your advantage just pick a few key things like what is the big idea and if you don't know what it is it means that one doesn't exist so don't go and try to make it up go back to the drawing board try again until you have that idea like what is the conceptual springboard that birth this moment talk about that set that part up and then tell them what it is now of course in a scripted tv show where they control the entire narrative for all all people and they have a ton of time to work on it it seems brilliant it seems effortless and that's probably how it should be but we all know these are not easy things to come by you have to sit there and you have to grind out you have to crack the the problem and and slay the beast and once you do it's super rewarding yeah and i think when you when you're able to make that connection and it clicks right you get that lift in the room uh and people see what you see and everybody's kind of on board that's that's a beautiful and exciting moment but we all know that that that's not always how it goes down right and so i think the other thing that you guys have done really well and most recently i think um just the other day i saw a video where you guys role played um objections and i thought that was really fun you guys kind of had uh a bell and whenever you got the objection right you ring the bell that was pretty funny but i think that's really important too to understand so you know when when for the listeners maybe who haven't seen that talk a little bit a bit about um dealing with client objections you know so it's one thing to be able to express this gut feeling that you think their brand needs to be but what happens when you got that one person in the room who's like yeah i don't know yeah that sort of thing how do you typically handle that when you feel like you've really done the work the brief is strong you've leaned into it and you're you're delivering something on brand and on brief and there's somebody who maybe for whatever reason is is creating tension talk a little bit about you know your process of working through that with him yes so you're talking about like when you have to do a big presentation there are multiple stakeholders in the room and everybody's got to weigh in on something inevitably if the group is big enough there's always one cynical person this uh we refer to them as the cynical skeptic no matter what you do they've seen it it's not good enough it's not tricky enough whatever it is because they pride themselves on their ability to just tear everything apart i think sometimes in corporate culture it's better for you to be the person who kills everything than the one person who says you know what let's champion that because now you put your neck out on the chopping block if it doesn't work out so in corporate culture there always tends to be at least one person in the room so typically what we do is if we know we're going to present and it's a big room what i do is i call them out before it even starts i say typically whenever i present there's always one person who's super skeptical i just describe exactly what i just said to you what i'm asking for you while we present is just give us the benefit the doubt for like 30 seconds just hang in there with us go with the narrative flow and if when we're done with talking about this and you're still skeptical and you have new ideas you want to offer i'm more than happy to tell you because if you kill it before it starts what's the point you've always just wasted a lot of time and money and so inevitably they all look around the room and everybody knows who i'm talking about sometimes they know oftentimes they do not know it's them right and so at least then i prepared so that one of two things will happen one they'll keep an open mind and they'll accept the idea and they're like yeah that's good okay cool now they don't want to say anything bad because they've already been put on notice or two they didn't even hear it they're gonna say what they're going to say but everybody in the room suddenly becomes aware that this person never gave the idea a shot now that's how i would set the stage but now it's going to get into objection handling so they're going to say something and what you need to do is hopefully prepare beforehand to say what are the three things that they're going to say to kill this thing torpedo it and how how are we going to respond and then you have a plan and who's going to respond to that and what's the one thing that we can't think of that they're going to say that's going to kill this whole thing and we try to strategize around that but once you're there and they bring up the objection i think the best thing that you can do and it's a it's a thing that i teach an objection handler is you embrace and then you pivot you embrace and then you pivot okay so first they need to be heard so if you don't respond if you don't acknowledge them they're going to keep saying it louder and louder and they're going to dig their heels in and once they're in because of the law of consistency they cannot change their mind even when they know they're wrong so first thing you acknowledge so if they say you know what i'm not sure this is going to work so you could say bob i hear you what part of this doesn't work for you so they don't do so what we're going to do is we're going to de-escalate we're going to walk them back from negative walk them slowly towards neutral and potentially leave them positive and so they're going to say something like um you know it feels like this thing and you know those things are hard to combat like oh we've seen something like this before it's like okay where have you seen this and how often have you seen this idea and have you ever seen an idea that you've not seen before so i try to use questions as a means to uh to to address their objections objection handling and then really what happens is you start to realize people don't really think about the things they say they just say them and they're never ever challenged or questioned and when you just ask them a few questions they will then slowly hopefully give up their position because it's not that really well thought out and that's all i try to do is just ask them more questions like okay so everything's been done or nothing's new or what are we talking about here and if you saw something new would you be happy because it would be so new nobody would understand it so really you know then they were like you know what you have some good points okay i'm okay with this let's try it that's usually how you handle it yeah this is great man great content so i want to i want to keep this sort of this energy going and i'm going to uh three questions i guess is is we'll start with the first one um what do you if you had one thing okay so you've you've got this body of educational uh content you're putting out there you've got all these things right and and people might come to to to your resources and they're like where do i start you know like what you know here i am i'm a freelance designer or i'm just getting started whatever might be what do you say to that that person who's new in the game maybe they just graduated college design school whatever that might be and you've got one thing for you got one you're only allowed to give them one thing all right so what's the most valuable thing for that new person coming into this industry that you're going to give them right now what's the one thing that you want to tell them as they begin their journey okay the one thing i would tell them is uh to be flexible to be curious and try things without overly committing to anything in the first part of your career coming out of school you need to try lots of stuff you might go out there thinking helvetica is my typeface and vanilla is always my ice cream and um you know a brown colored porsche is the thing that's it and i just say you know you're too new you're too new just go and try lots of things and do not over commit to realize that your time to sort it all out is long but if you over commit to one thing you all of a sudden box yourself and paint yourself into the corner so you might think i like interactive design i might i like video game design or am i like advertising i don't know but right now you should try i mean i think it's pretty archaic of a concept these days to say you know what the first person you see on the street you should marry them and everybody would just laugh at you like why would i do that i'm like okay well don't shoot your career your life and everything that you do like that just because that's what you started with doesn't mean that's where you end in fact many people change their careers and pursue different things the point of it all is to figure that out earlier than later because time is not on your side so what you want to do is you want to play you want to explore be curious stay flexible until you start to get a feel and have a more informed point of view before you make that decision like okay it feels like i want to go all in on this that's the first piece of advice i'd give them great all right that's good feedback now let's let's jump into the old cats the the guys who've been and girls who've been in this for a minute they're maybe they're uh you know acd maybe they're uh senior copywriter maybe they're a copy director you know maybe they're they're at the top of their game they're the executive creative director what do you say to them what's the thing they need to hear you got one thing to give them what do they need to hear you've been you've been in this game for a long time now what do you say to them oddly enough it's going to sound very similar to the first piece of advice and as you're listening you might find the nuance or you might say this guy's saying the same thing over and over what i would say here is that there's an expression it goes something like this change is inevitable progress is a choice and that as you've grown deeper into your career you've deformed many specific habits and ways of looking at the world you you would go you fall back on the kinds of strategies that worked in the past maybe same spaces of inspiration and you start to dismiss all the new things that are coming up as meh it's a fad and you know i think at one time somebody said uh i'll forget who it was but computers are a fad well and then you move on the internet is a fad social media is a bad well it's not a fad it's new and in order for you to stay at least young in at heart and young in mind is to be able to stay flexible it's okay for you to say 80 percent of the world i know works this way but keep it 20 open so that when you are open to new influences new ideas and new art that way you stay fresh because the kids are going to always be chomping at your feet trying to offer you new things and you might wind up as being a relic you you become that thing that you hated when you started that old guard that that the people who who are married to to tradition and dogma you've become that person inadvertently you woke up one day and you you're that guy or you're that gal so in this way you you should explore you should always be thinking well if my industry is disrupted what does that look like and plan for that so that you're part of the change and not the person that gets replaced by the change all right that's good that's good there's there's two two for two so this next question is is going to be maybe challenging uh what do you say to yourself you've had a successful career you've you've worked for brands you've launched your your media company where you're helping people to you know educate people to get paid what they love to do for a living but what about you i mean somebody who's giving so much of themselves to others how do you stay fulfilled yourself so i guess what's the what's your feedback to yourself the one thing that you're trying to listen to internally right now what's that i think it's uh i'm gonna cheat here a little bit it's not exactly one thing but i recently wrote a post on this i want you to think of your life like a bicycle and the bicycle works with two wheels one wheel doesn't work so well three wheels is a different thing it needs two wheels and it's usually driven when you're young through passion so that's the back wheel the thing that pedals and pushes you forward the thing that literally drives you and then the front wheel is what steers you that's your purpose and you need those two to work in concert if purpose is turned to the side you're going to be just you're going to be running around in a circle because you don't know what it is that you want so purpose guides while passion drives and you need to have both of those in alignment and to understand that you may not want know what the purpose is until later in your life like for me it's into my 40s i'm starting to figure this thing out like you know what i'm done chasing uh the money i'm done chasing the fame and the fortune all those kinds of things i've i got as much as i want i'm good what is the next thing and so when you get to that point you start to think about the life the impression that you want to leave on the planet before you expire i think you get one shot of this life make the most of it so for me it's the purpose that keeps me in a movie in a specific direction and it's connected to my passion and when those two work together in concert you can go really far baby and and you can you can outrun the best long distance runner you could beat every single long distance runner because you're much more efficient and you're going to use your energy well so those two need to come together purpose and passion think of it as a bicycle somebody wrote this is psychology spelled like cycle c-y-c-l-e this is the psychology of success um man good stuff man i i really really appreciate this i know the listeners are taking notes and tuning in and as always you know you've always got uh something interesting to say so um what do you what's next for you what what what's what what's the next thing what is there anything that you can tease for us that you guys are you know uh that you're cooking up or you know where do you go from here brandon what is next this we have such a giant huge mission which is teach a billion people i probably could live multiple lifetimes and still fall short of achieving that goal so for me it's always thinking about how do we challenge ourselves how do we continue to grow and when we hit certain plateaus it's scary for me whether our it's just the end of our reach or can we speak about other things how do we grow this company because in order for this to work we have to be better teachers we have to learn how to play in the different social platforms and they're constantly evolving changing with algorithm and people's taste and what they like to use they're very fickle so the advice that i gave to you both for young people and for older people has to apply to me as well right now i still want to try lots of things and i also want to keep an open mind and not be swallowed up by progress because i'm too proud to evolve so i'm going to keep an eye on that as well excellent excellent well i'm sure there's a lot of people listening that want to want to be a part of your mission so it could be brands could be other creatives could be other agencies what's the best way for people to get in touch with you to to be able to connect in in like-minded ways yes thank you very much for asking that question we'd love your help we'd love your help in any which way that you can tap into what it is that we're doing the best place to go is to go to thefuture.com uh the future's spelt without an e somebody had asked me a while ago why is the future not spelled with the e where did the ego and i said you know what we dropped the ego that's why there's no each so it's futur.future.com you can find me pretty much on every single social platform that exists and probably with the exception of tick tock i still can't figure that one out yet but i'm at the chris doe do is my last name you can send me a dm and i'd be more than happy to hear from you love to work with sponsors who want to be part of this dream of ours teachers love you students all of you anybody that wants to help us with this this big challenge of education in the 21st century i would love your help thank you man that's that's so great and i appreciate you for coming on the show and uh man um what a great conversation and i wish you guys the best of luck with your big giant mission and uh thanks so much for creating the content i'm uh i'm uh a follower as well so i watch the videos and i

I just wanna let you know about a couple of things one there's two forms of
stealing bad stealing is when you take from one source and good stealing is
when you take from many sources and I know that because they stole that from
Austin Kleon okay so I kind of picture myself as a modern-day Robin Hood I
steal from the information rich and I give it to you the time poor and that's
how we do this and like many of you I have a humble dream I have a little
dream that I too want to be a Silicon Valley billionaire right but not that
kind of billionaire more like the jason silva billionaire which isn't your
wealth isn't measured by what's in your bank account it's measured by the lives
that you touch on planet earth and I want to be a billionaire so badly in
that kind of way so in essence my business is to help people learn how to
value themselves and how to communicate their value to others and this isn't
just a pie in the sky dream it's not a fantasy because I know that a dream with
the plan is a goal and that's the formula a dream with the plan is a goal
so I want to let you know what the definition of my goal is what success
looks like what I want to be able to do is to create a platform that provides
education from all no matter where you come from no matter how old you are or
how young you are and that means that we need to make education really affordable
something that we're working on every single day
and we want to be able to attract the best teachers because when you have the
best teachers the best students show up and they attract the best teachers again
and we want to be able to embrace technology and drag education out of the
19th century and bring it to the 21st century and that means it will also be
inventing new pedagogical models it's the theory of teaching right and if we
were do a ballista by-product of what we're going to be able to do the
byproduct or a success will be to disrupt the education system that's what
we want to do my hope because my youngest boy is here he's up front he's
13 years old now so by the time he's 18 we'll have built a truly viable
to the current education system that exists okay good I'm making sure the
slides are right there okay so over the last five years I've been experimenting
with this education platform building our audience I want to share some of the
lessons that we've learned and how we were able to escape the system and in
doing so we've been able to grow our company 300 percent year-over-year since
2014 and if all goes well if all goes according to the plan we will never work
with another client ever again that's the dream you guys that's the dream I
wish it for all of you if that's possible
okay so the focus of my talk today is really about how to grow your audience
how to gain influence and to get known because people hire people that they
know like and trust okay but before I do that I just want to share with you my
short origin creation story I love teaching
nothing makes me feel more life than teaching and on occasion my wife would
accompany me at school and she would sit in class and she's a designer too and as
soon as class is over I'm very eager to get in the car with them really looking
forward to the part cuz when we drive I get to ask her so give me the feedback
how was I cuz you've you know anything about Asian women they're not shy to
tell you how they really feel and there's no sandwich technique it's all
meet in the middle okay so I dared to ask her even though I know what's coming
and driving I'm like so what do you think how was class today and so the
long drive from Pasadena to Santa Monica it's a long time you guys and she said
well you know you're really good at teaching it's amazing to watch you teach
but there's that word but she became a butthole right there but do you ever get
tired of teaching the same thing over and over again do you think you want to
teach more people than the eleven students who can afford to pay this very
high education if I'm being honest she says to me I'm not sure you're living up
to your potential
you could hear my teeth grinding right when I tell that story not my potential
like what what you know I started feeling all kinds of things but didn't
say anything was just driving turn up the volume a little bit on the radio I
was getting angry frustrated and resentful inside and I was thinking you
know at this point in time in my life had already been teaching for 15 years
at Art Center a very prestigious design school the one that I went to so what do
you mean I'm not living up to my potential then I started to realize I
was slipping into the five stages of grieving some people don't know so I'm
gonna show you you go through denial in isolation you feel angry you start to
bargain you want to make deals with people you get really depressed and then
finally if you're smart enough you just accept I got let you know if you're
curious acceptance has a very bitter taste to it so I'm gonna give you guys a
low-tech life act right now which is whenever you're facing something an idea
scares you just skip steps 1 through 4 just go straight to accept and yes ma'am
can have another okay so she was she put his inception this idea inside my mind
but I didn't know how to do this I was so used to doing it a certain way I knew
she was right I just didn't know how so luck would have it a few months later
I was at a meeting and I ran into an old friend of mine and my spider-sense was
really tingling this old friend was classmate from school and the event
happened not quite like this it's not as dramatic but I didn't know it at the
time but he would later on become my mentor and then my nemesis and that's
how these stories go right his name is Jose and he's like Christo let's start
an education company together it's like you want this too and I want this maybe
we should join forces and try this thing out and see what happens he says okay
we're gonna make products we're gonna sell products but in order to do that we
have to get onto YouTube you know the top of the funnel awareness what top of
the funnel awareness we're gonna make videos that's how
people are gonna to know was and then they'll buy our products and I felt
funny about it for a lot of different reasons because at this point in time my
life I'm used to being behind the camera not in front of the camera and I started
to rationalize and think it through like the pros and cons like a dutiful Asian
person like what are we gonna do I thought to myself you know I'm gonna go
out there I'm gonna look like a fool and I didn't know what I'm gonna say and
lame but even care and I had a lot riding on the line because at that point
we probably were about 18 years into our business and had clients who might see
something and me to say it and offend them that would be really really bad so
as far as I can tell lots of risk low upside potential what am I gonna do so I
went searching for answers sought the advice of the Oracle you know Twitter
Twitter told me that there's some searching and I came upon this tweet
from Jeff Bezos failure intervention are inseparable twins in order to do
something new we must be willing to fail we must be willing to lose it all and
everything seems so uncertain unclear at that point I was thinking to myself your
name is Chris doe it's not Chris don't ya all right thank you guys you're very
generous all right and saying yes in this moment changed my life forever so I
just want to let you guys know that's what your courage is for so when
something is really scary you should say yes lose it all
yes scared to death yes just say yes unless it's the typology iPod challenge
then say no but everything else say yes well not for the hot water challenge
either that you say no okay yes I know I know okay so here are things I've
learned so I just won't let you guys now this is the time when the photos might
get going okay so here's the first part networking is who you know right
networking who you know but influence is who knows you and this is part we want
to focus on how to get people to oh you and I love this quote I think is
from John Maxwell he says to be an interesting person you have to be
interested in people so you have to get to know people if you want people to
know you so the first rule is stop selling start serving this was key to
the biggest breakthrough in our channel at that point in time we had about 1,300
subscribers and this is one thing that I learned that you know the Internet is a
vast free media playground it's the first mass communication platform that
wasn't specifically invented to sell advertising so the rule is social media
is not a license to spam and back then we just made videos to sell our products
so nobody tuned in nobody cared because it was a thinly disguised commercial so
what we need to do is when we make videos we need to inform or entertain
and if you can do both you're doing really good so people want help they
want you to help them improve their lives so do something to improve their
lives so this is the first time where I actually sat down wrote a piece of
content with no other purpose than to improve people's lives to teach them
something that I knew so we didn't sell and what happened was the views went up
people tuned in they started to care and then slowly but surely this video became
the number one search result for identity design and a top 10 search
result for branding ok so if you don't tune into anything else this is the part
you probably want to pay attention to the rest of it just supports this ok
there's just four little rules here be consistent that means you show up every
single day and give it your best you be professional to give generously with
zero expectations of anybody reciprocating anything to you
and lastly be respectful of people's times so whatever you make consider that
they're giving you their most valuable resource their time now we all know this
every company here has customers but the few great companies have an audience now
here's the difference between an audience and a customer ok
that in order to get customers to pay attention you have to pay them to pay
attention whereas an audience is excited to give you their TNA their time and
attention it's also known as a true fan Kevin Kelley's definition of a true fan
is somebody will buy anything from you that's it and all you need is the
thousand true fans to give you $100 to have a six-figure income
yeah it's not that hard guys 1,000 true fans oh you guys are like that's pretty
hard I'm sorry I'm being insensitive right now I'm sorry okay and they'll buy
anything that you make here's a couple other ways you can test to see if
they're true fans one is to drive over 200 miles or 322 kilometers to come see
you speak or out of concert I just want to give a shout out to Chelsea out here
from Newcastle Australia right they'll buy your book your ebook and your
audiobook of the same book right they'll pay for the video compilation of the
videos you already give out for free that is the true fan a true fan will
shoot another true fan watching you and send it to you which is pretty crazy and
if you could tell this is an Oslo Norway what are the odds that two fans are
riding the same train in doing this pretty cool so what you need to do in
exchange for their time and attention is to give tremendous value and when you do
that something awesome happens so this was a joke started out as a joke people
started saying I feel guilty for watching the videos I feel like I
cheated so this hashtag began hashtag 10% and
this kid on Twitter reached out to me said Chris I want to be the first person
to send you 10% uncle Chris we're gonna take care of you and he said it's not a
lot of money I don't think much of it except for one day I get this envelope
and it opened up and sure enough it was a cheque it was a tiny amount I go home
and tell my wife honey you just won't believe what happened if you look at
what's in the hot side this envelope you may cry she tears all open I hope she
looks at it it's like oh my god did you see what he wrote in the memo
I'm now if you look in there I'd even see
that part I was just focused on the $12.50 the memo says for a better life
then she tells me you can't keep this check the kid is sending you a 12-pound
50-cent check send it back to him cancel this I said I can't do that what
an insult that would be like that's not enough for me so I cashed it okay all
right here's nothing you need to know that marketing isn't about selling it's
the generous act of helping other people achieve their goals and not your role
it's the generous act of helping other people achieve their goals it's an
opportunity to serve and the way that you can do this is you can ask yourself
a couple of questions who are they what are their hopes and fears what did
they dream of becoming what change do they seek now you can even do this if
you're if you got a really boring job like an insurance broker look at this
note here I paid your parking meter for you imagine what else I'm willing to do
to protect our car that to me is somebody who understands the customer
okay now I know that I'm speaking to a large UX UI design community you guys
know about empathy graphs and with the maps you know how to do this kind of
stuff so once you identify who these people are look for the gaps okay use
sorry I go too fast there we go use use all your creative energy your
curiosity empathy and imagination identify the task the gap and the
opportunity it would look something like this
okay you go through their life day in their life and you write down everything
they're trying to do that day at home and at work and you try to imagine like
what's getting in their way of achieving this this is the gap and then use the
rest of it to write down ideas that you can generate now you could use this for
anything for marketing you could use to develop products physical or otherwise
now I will let you guys know how we found our audience so the first part is
this we knew that there are a lot of really young charismatic people on
YouTube they're largely inexperienced and they didn't have any real knowledge
but they were very charismatic then we knew that there
celebrated designers who are too busy and too indifferent to get onto YouTube
because that was beneath them but they were professional and they had the
experience so immediately we saw that gap we could fill that gap the second
part we saw is this is that teachers want the best students they want to make
a difference because that's why they got into teaching in the first place not to
make money they want relevancy they want to develop intellectual property and
build a passive income if possible and they want some flexibility do I have to
show up today or can I do this remotely students want something very similar if
you can see the two they almost line up students want the best teachers they
want to get a job they want the most relevant content and get the highest
return on investment and they also want some flexibility we're gonna fill that
gap ok next point people don't fall in love with corporations you're gonna do
this some audience participation of this next part people fall in love with ok
it's not a unanimous crowd here I heard people people fall in love with gaps
that was kind of meta ok I don't know about that ok people don't fall in love
with corporations they fall in love with personalities ok so you need to find
your voice you gotta find your voice and I love this bit right so you guys know
who Hasan Minhaj is he has to show a Netflix Patriot Act it's amazing so I
was watching the show and he's talking about something I was like this is
genius it's complete genius he puts up his face as a pie chart he says those
who doesn't know me know that I'm 65% hip-hop and that the 17% the rest of me
is really about hair products and mid-90s NBA references and intense eye
contact I've seen what a wonderful way to define your own personal brand in
your voice and there was something really interesting because it was the
first time I saw a mainstream comedian talk about his brown culture going to UC
Davis and hating UC Santa Cruz and bringing in some hindi I think and doing
the whole uncle thing and I loved it so when I watched him he gave me
permission to be myself to embrace you and all the weird parts about you
because the truth is people out there are searching for belonging and they're
trying to find their tribe so I thought maybe I should try it on my own self
there's my head what's that look like so 68% Swiss modern typography you know 18%
snapback caps that's the lads gotta go 11% skin care products designer eyewear
and point zero one percent hair product my sounds like that you don't use hair
products that's why the point zero one and you could use this for so many
different things right 68 percent Helvetica now 18 percent champion Gothic
feature bold in and everything else so I want to encourage you to make your own
face chart and figure it out so I'm gonna help you out and give you some
prompts okay one is think about the things that you're really passionate
about that pretty much makes the entire face chart for a son what are your
physical attributes the weird things that people say dude you remind me of
that that's what you write down your history where you come from your
ethnicity all the parts that you were kind of ashamed of when you're a kid
celebrate now what skills do you have what are you good at and what makes you
quirky the things that make you not normal make you unique in the world and
then use that as a voice or creation filter when you make something push it
through that funnel and see what comes out I have some examples to share with
you my son writes mean there's no dad can you snuggle later when mommy goes to
sleep and calls you yeah I could do that but I could turn this into a Twitter
post instead so use mark it up that's my filter right I'm a dad a
typographer and in a nut job why not write and then I love these like little
Massimo Vignelli's Canon things right and I'm searching on Pinterest for these
things and they're poorly designed Massimo would be turning over in his
grave so I redesigned them in the spirit of Massimo so forever if you do it right
it will last forever and a great is like underwear you wear it but it's not it's
not to be exposed and then I started to take that and so to take Paul Rand
posters and just put his thoughts and the design is so simple that's why it's
okay complicated right I can't even read this
one what is they don't try to be original just try to be good so when you
do these things sometimes you agitate other designers and I like to do it on
purpose so the two most hated typefaces you guys know what's come in comic sans
I have my intern work on him from month and a half to design me a poster didn't
suck using Comic Sans there it is right for the matrix and it's like what's the
other one papyrus yes you guys know you want to say what you won't say it witty
will he go there yes I did go there papyrus you know just to agitate
emotions because I want to push buttons okay so that means I'm not afraid to be
polarizing so here are the four traits of being an attractive character you
guys ready here we go one you have to have a
compelling backstory that's why I told you mine too you have to have character
flaws obviously three are the parables the stories that you use to teach
lessons in and the last one the one that people struggle with the most is to be
polarizing you have to take a stand and
come on okay you have to be able to take that risk and stand for something
because what you do when you're polarizing is you incite people's
passions you stir their emotions you fire people up you get them to do
something so I love this campaign from from Nike it's only a crazy dream until
you do it with Serena Williams and Colin Kaepernick but leave in something even
if it means sacrificing everything and then of course the Avengers infinity
version of that which is believe in something even it means sacrificing half
of everything right it's that good okay sorry spoiler alert
okay all right here we go so what you want to do is get people to choose a
side are you on Team Apple yes or team PC hmm okay are you a Marvel person or a
DC person are you a new house core test person or Helvetica now person you see
there's dilemmas choices to be made what you don't want to do is to be stuck in
the middle because the middle is boring it's bland its generic and nobody cares
people are indifferent about the middle love me hate me I
for one of the other okay now here's an example I don't know if you guys are
aware of Wendy's the Twitter account savage savage okay
turns out that Amy Brown was doing the tweets and she started noticing that
McDonald's and the competitors were very corporate mumbo jumbo talk and these
tweets went viral because it was so refreshing because it was not corporate
so let me share some of those with you relationship advice right ah
I want Wendy's but my girlfriend wants McDonald's what do I do
Randy's response they're playing a fish in the sea
okay I know it's brutal gross okay here we go
McDonald's is better at freezing beef retroactively story telling those guys
my workshop okay why is your beef square because we don't cut corners so good so
good right right okay going to in and out what should I get out oh my god
here's the last one I think this is the last one like so this is Eric he's like
I hope every person who ever thought I would fail sees this he's got he's proud
he's got his seat warmers he's got the McDonald's bag okay and then when he
says back looks at the logo on bag you failed right it's great so if you want
to get known take a side choose a lane and commit to it it'll be okay okay so I
love this from dr. Jordan Peterson he says to think you have to risk being
offensive that's what critical thinking is the
friction that exists between what you think and what I think that's where it
exists okay now the best place to find is critical
thinking is troll universe Twitter it is the best place so I'm going to share
with you my content strategy okay this is where people just engage in vitriolic
debate it does even matter if they know you're not okay here's the content
strategy I've been using this and it's been awesome so far okay what I want to
do is try an idea out so I'll write something on Twitter if forces we need
to write in really condensed format and I sit around like a person who's fishing
I'm waiting for the trolls to come out attack it what they do is they help you
write your own thought that you shouldn't say this you should say this
and this is the wrong choice of words and use watch and you engage and then
you take the new learning and you retweet it back out and
if it works again what I then do is I take that I turn into a graph I could
post on Facebook and LinkedIn I write more about it and if that works I'm
gonna go and record a video so all I'm doing is converting one kind of energy
to another and you don't have to write a video like you like Pablo said you can
write a medium post and save your career and I just I want to remind you about
this okay conversations are supposed to be
direction bi-directional meaning you put something out and you react so we're
having that dialogue so many people get this wrong they put something out in the
universe and they don't read anything don't respond to anything that's not a
conversation so read the comments they'll tell you what they want from you
okay here's the strategy for long-form content okay so we do a lot of long-form
content take a big piece of content chop it up into tiny little pieces put that
out everywhere on every platform and see what bites see what people engage with
you can even ask them to timestamp the video so that you know what they're
reacting to now what you want to do is reframe that possibly re-edit it and put
a new title on it based on what people connect with that's the formula you just
do that over and over again and then when you have a video that you think is
hot spend a little bit of money and boost it to like audiences people who
like this like this all right well I'm at a time okay I'm gonna rush through
this last part here so what we want to do is to out teach the competition
because big companies are obsessed with secrecy that is the old way to do it you
don't want to be the best kept secret in Silicon Valley for sure okay so give
them the tour of the factory and insiders peak take them behind the
scenes and show them how the sausage is made they'll become your true fans I'm
gonna give you an example here I was in a W Hotel in Taipei I made a video in
their branding it was great I have nothing to do with their branding but we
are the number one search result when you type in W Hotel branding for video
ok think like a chef okay chefs literally give away all their secrets so
what are your recipes secret sauce mystery ingredient teach people how to
make what you make and this could look like research reference drawings plans
sketches interviews photography journals notebooks
down those diagram scrapbooks how-to-videos what you want to do is to
start writing your cookbook okay but then you sit there and say well I have
nothing to say what I'm gonna do well then you've heard this expression teach
what you know and then you get into this existential crisis and say well it is
knowing anyways right so that could be daunting like I don't know that really
how could I teach that so let's revise the phrase teach while you learn now
everybody can do that teach while you learn it's a little while ago we
launched a typography course and to my amazement $149 course did six figures
during the launch and here's the thing days before I would do each recording
each lecture I would just read just enough so I didn't sound like an idiot
and nobody has complained okay here's the thing
experts forget the struggle they skip over the important steps everything is
so easy for them but the beginner's mind said teaching while you learn you're
curious you're more relatable you're honest you're transparent you make
discoveries and you create artifacts you rediscover it again with your audience
while you sharing with them and they're very gracious when you tell them that
upfront okay see progress not perfection because we know that perfection can
paralyze because big ideas take a long time to make and we need the help of
others to make them happen we need money we need resources and it's very hard to
start and I love this from South Koda and he says whoever fails the most wins
you want to play the game forever for as long as possible by making small
Gamble's so make tiny decisions it's easier to change course and guess what
there's no catastrophic ending if you get it wrong so here's the just to rule
applied the just to rule okay it goes something like this just to the sign
just to the car just to the light post set small milestones and hit them
progress is contagious and momentum is built that means that you can take a
1:12 beat project and turn it into 12 one-week projects almost down here
summary here we go you guys will watch a channel you know
how to do this okay here we go so you didn't need to take any other slides
here we go help others achieve their goals
don't sell an audience is greater and more valuable than customers treat them
accordingly to become an attractive character you must be willing to risk to
being polarizing and while the other ones are hoarding their secrets you
share all of your seekers out teach the competition teach while you learn write
your cookbook today and see progress not perfection
now it's an amazing time to be alive because there are no more gatekeepers no
more middle managers and there's no better time to be alive I'm going to
send you off there's still some middle managers I got it okay I'm gonna close
out with Gary Vaynerchuk and he said that ideas are worthless execution is
the game thank you very much everybody





what is one thing that you want more of right now that's going to be help to your life and to your career what do you want money money money is not what you really want you want to do something that by doing that thing people value so much they give you money what's the maximum that you can charge it's Limitless everybody it is only limited by the value that you can generate if you do good work you're really good at what you do what's a theoretic limit I don't know I haven't found it the problem with some of these scammer influencer people is they take more money than the value they give people who have mastered building a personal brand have created outsized influence that their company benefits from directly and indirectly so if you focus all your energies on marketing and doing more advertising you might be using your money not as smartly as you could what I would do is it's always amazing for me like when we throw out on the internet we're going to be somewhere and then some people show up and then more people show up and it gets really hot in here um but I'm always excited to chat with you usually the construct of the the meetups is to maybe provide a different side to what we do that you normally don't get I'm borrowing Concepts that I barely understand but I package them in way that I think maybe might help you apply it so if there's anybody who knows much more than the surface level of this they I welcome them to to join in on the conversation so when we see people post content on social media most people use social media as a form of advertising advertising is so dominant in the in popular culture that we think the only way we can talk to people is to advertise them and what I ask people to do is if you reflect on the content that you post on a regular basis how much of that content is selling and positioning you as an expert how much of it is you promoting something that you're doing where you're going to extract more value than what you're giving into the world and then you start to see there's a disproportionate amount of content content that you're putting out there is thinly disguised as advertising and marketing for your Professional Service firm yes that bothers me a bit and I say that also because we did that at the beginning of our content strategy so if you're there Circ of January 2014 I'm I'm a bab in the wood I don't know what I'm doing and I'm posting content almost all of it is like we tease the course material such that you would be left wondering oh I need to learn this therefore I must buy this from you can anybody predict what happened then with the content and how audience felt there's only one anybody a sales funnel it is a sales funnel absolutely right somewhere in the back we are advertising and selling to people in a very interruptive way and and almost no one wants to open up their email to read an ad or to be sold to almost no one shows up and looks through a magazine or newspaper or or watches TV to see the ads when I say almost no one there's always a few weirdos like the ad people who show up to watch us the ads because it's part of the tradecraft which we understand right and that's part of their their cultural language to understand what XYZ brand and what XYZ agency is doing but the rest of us we've become pretty good at tuning that out I come upon Carl Young Yan philosophy or therapy right so there's this thing called The Shadow word and young unlike Freud has a different relationship with the ego right so this is the the the stuff you can Wikipedia right or the thing that g GPT will tell me the ego regulates between the shadow the things that you have anxiety that makes you nervous that makes you feel some sense of shame or guilt and the Persona and the Persona is who you show up in the world to be accepted yes so in in youngian ideology the ego regulates these two make sense so far most of us live in the Persona and we don't even know it we live in the Persona we dress a certain way we speak a certain thing we we pursue a a professional career because someone told us that's what you do to be accepted and it's it's kind of important to understand this to be not accepted by Society to not to feel like you have a tribe it's a very scary thing you feel really isolated alone and as social creatures we need to feel connected to other humans intimate like in small circles and also in larger circles like if you go to work and you don't dress the way that people dress you're going to be isolated right so we've gotten really good at blending in to become like everybody to to be quote unquote normal and I'll tell you why there's problems with this if you look up in the dictionary the word normal it it kind of means average the standard normal so we have ego and we have it regulating between your Shadow Self the Shadow and the Persona so we talked about the Persona is you show up to be accepted right to to be quote unquote normal and normal is just another word for average so we're okay saying I I I want to be normal I don't think we're okay with saying I want to be average anybody here want to be average but that's what we're doing we're showing up to blend into being average and so this seems counterintuitive if you want to build any kind of social media following if you want to be any kind of thought leader in fact to be a thought leader to be a 1center according to Mark Manson you have to be a contrarian you have to go against what the what everybody believes to be a contrarian okay in a contrarian you could say well it's a flat Earth Chris so we have to add one more word in you have to be a correct contrarian okay so you have to find like where everyone goes this way you're going to go this way but you have to be right and that's a difficult part so a lot of this is you developing your your point of view of the world sh sharing your lived experiences and finding the angle where almost everybody believes it to be this way and then I'm going to go this way how many of you have been struggling to write consistently good posts and stories probably everybody in the room is because you don't know what defines your character that's why this is just First Step okay so what happens is I don't want to write so you might get through like post 1 through 10 or 1 through 100 but by 101 or whatever you're kind of stuck you know what to do so I'm going to make a prediction as to what you mostly do you follow some person social influencer says oh you're stuck use this headline use this hack 10 content ideas so you're creating pieces of content that not tied into the larger version of who you are you're just writing little stories they're like Standalone episodes that don't tie back to this universe that you're building around you does that make sense and the problem with this it might work at the beginning you get a hit you get a hit and you get a dud and you're like who am I writing for who am I what's the story I'm trying to tell so in your world as the main character in your Universe you kind of have to have pretty clear defined character let me ask you something what is one thing that you want more of right now that's going to be a help to your life and to your career what do you want money money is that what you said okay all right before we go there cuz I always ask people what do they want they say money and they said lots of it right okay money is not what you really want you want to do something that by doing that thing people value so much they give you money money is the result not the pursuit itself because I've seen lots of people pursue money they're they're neither happy nor Rich it's kind of weird right I believe this like money is a metric that is measuring impact so the more impact that you can make in life the more money you will get so then the real question is how can you create this impact what is the impact you want to create in the world what money does is it buys your freedom that's the whole point of money right and to be rich rich in that you can afford to spend time with whoever you want for as long as want doing whatever it is you want that's what we all want you don't always need money to get there so sometimes we think we need more money but what we want is more freedom and not freedom but freedom to do what it is is that gives us joy ultimately right cuz sometimes more money doesn't actually do that for you all right so the reason why I suspect and I'm not casting any judgment on you right now if you're unclear about the impact you want to make in the world there's a good chance that you're not going to make a lot of money and you're going to have less Freedom if you shoot photos photographers are pretty upset right now because there's so many people doing it so you have to innovate a little bit in what you do but what is going to help you and it's hard for me to tell you this because you're you're looking at your primary need your first order which is I got to feed myself so what you do is you do the very thing that is not going to help you grow your Authority that's the problem I don't know how else to tell you that because everywhere I go I'm like work on who you are tell that story and we can talk about how to do that and then people go right back to here's what I do I need a client so I wrote this little document it's very little and we call The Four Agreements it's a play on the same idea but it's a different it's a different idea okay number one is you must do good work and I'll explain what each one of these means you must do good work there's a lot of people who look at the concepts in which we teach haven't put in the energy and effort to do good work and so they're they're just living on top of a lie if we can just agree in this room that you've put in the time practice and intention behind doing good work like the Malcolm Gladwell like the 10,000 hours of deliberate intentional practice you do good work does anybody not do good work who's so new into their field or pretending right now then no one will raise their hand but I'm sure there's one or two people always there is you do good work next uh you charge a fair price for this good work that you do charge a fair price people are like well what is fair that's a complicated word word I understand so what you have to do is just give more value than what you charge that's it right so if you charge $100 for something all it has to be is $11 or 101b whatever it is that make sense so the question I have for all of you to think about is what's the maximum that you can charge what's the maximum that you can charge is there a maximum I don't know is there it's limit it's Limitless everybody it is only limited by the value that you can generate all right watch this it's not a magic trick if you do good work you're really good at what you do what's the theoretic limit I don't know I haven't found it your client's value value you can no no no I can charge whatever if they don't value that's a whole another story I'm just saying if you pay me a million dollars I give you a million plus the more I can give the better I can sleep at night right so number three is we act in service of others this one's really tricky for you guys not you specifically but mostly for Crea that if we serve others ahead of our need to make money we can be honorable in how we run our business so that means very rarely does the client have a problem that you can solve if you accept that you'll take away most of the pressure in the buy sell cycle with the prospect so when they when you hear a problem that's is not to your benefit you must recommend to them you must pursue that it's my recommendation based on what I've learned from you today unless things change that you pursue this other option unfortunately I don't do that I can help find you somebody or at least this is what I know somebody else might tell you different but I'm telling you this based on what I know that's it the last one is always act with Integrity that means you're willing to do the difficult things that's it over there in the back by the door to answer my question but I was going to ask if there were ever any occasions where there could be two Works CU I think um I think if you if you're teaching something perhaps you've become so good at teaching that the skill that you're working on as well you put your 10,000 hours into they can combine in a very very positive way yes the answer is yes if you can teach what you're doing while you're doing it you've Advanced to the next level very few people know what they're doing how to do it even fewer people can teach others how to do it so teaching is a critical part to your own development so if you can teach other people how to do what you do number one you become much more efficient you become seen as an authority and you get to help other people and chances are when you help other people you make the kind of impact that you want to make and your audience grows I make my marketing department have the same philosophy and try to what philosophy is that um um focus um try to combine your skills with learning these different streams and Maring and it work with it well whenever we ask a question like that we search in our mind what company's been able to pull that off if we can find zero companies then we say probably not then but we find a handful even just one where like it's possible maybe not probable but it's possible I live in the state of mind where I think if it's remotely possible for anybody the first thing is like why not me why not me and I'll be the first I'm okay or if I'm the second that's a fine too okay the question I thought you were going to ask is a little bit different so let's say this your company right and the company mostly talks about what they do cuz they're mostly getting new clients so when you start to build your personal brand your PB it doesn't feel that connected so what do you do you wind up talking about more of what you do so you just became you just become more of the same become super noisy right but I know this if you were to look up on Twitter and see how many followers Apple has versus how many followers followers Tim Cook has huh it's disproportionate Tim Cook has way more followers as Does Elon Musk versus Tesla as does Richard Branson versus virgin right so it's telling you something here that the people who have mastered building their personal brand have created outsize influence that their company benefits from directly and indirectly so if you focus all your energies on marketing and doing more advertising you might be using your money not as smartly as you could






What's up Chris.
Hey Mo
I'm super glad you can take this call.
I was hoping.
That you could cut up one of those banger videos that you
make that I see on your website.
I'd love to do that for you.
What's your budget?
I have a thousand dollars.
A thousand bucks.
Is this video important to you?
I think it will be.
If you do it.
No problem doesn't solve for a thousand dollars.
We're trying to build awareness.
No one's walking into the to the store.
Okay so how much awareness do you want it to build.
You know I'd like to have at least.
Two to three people walk into the store.
An increase of two to three people.
A day a day sorry a day.
And so what kind of business would that generate for you.
Our average product sells for about 100 bucks.
So you're looking at about 200 to 300 dollars worth of
increased revenue.
Okay.
So let's say 250.
Split the difference.
That sounds good to me.
Time's 30 days.
Right.
Three days a month on average.
What does that work out to be?
That's.
Seventy five hundred dollars of new revenue for you.
A month.
Mm hmm.
Does spending a thousand dollars seem appropriate for seventy
five hundred dollars of revenue per month?
It's more than 10 percent right.
A month.
Are you gonna do a thousand dollar value every month?
Maybe if you do this one good.
I'm a little concerned.
This is not enough money.
And I'd like to share with you a quote I love from a business
philosopher.
Jim.
Rome.
So it feels a little disproportionate.
Doesn't it.
When you say that quote I think it does?
You can't just roll right into.
You can't.
I mean you do business.
You don't want to.
You don't want to overspend and there's are you going to
guarantee me seventy five hundred dollars a month.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm just trying to measure effort versus result.
Ok.
When somebody comes to me and they say I don't have a lot of
money to do something?
My first instinct is hey let's not do it.
It's not important.
Would that be your instinct too?
Yeah.
Where else can you spend your thousand dollars to make a
bigger impact on your business?
Because I don't wanna take your money to do something that's not
important.
Is it important or isn't it?
I mean I think it's important.
Not a thousand other important.
Don't break Mo
Can you elaborate on what you mean by not a thousand dollar
important?
If you look at the expenses and things that you spend on
personal and business.
Where does that thousand dollars rank in the things that you
spend?
Is it on the high end or is it on the low end?
Like how much did that refrigeration unit cost and.
How much of the AC?
And when you went into new to do the Polish floors What did you
spend on that.
And how did that have any material impact on your
business?
You see what I'm saying now I do and I saw the BMW parked
outside.
The five series the M5 and I think you see what I'm saying
that was really important to you.
So I find that in my my life and my experience that people tend
to spend money on what they value.
That mean that makes perfect sense.
Don't you think like.
If you like a fancy pair of pants you'll spend the money for
that and if you don't you buy the.
Cheaper version.
So when somebody comes to me as I have a real business problem
Chris and I want to spend a thousand big smacker Rooney's on
it I think I don't think that's a real problem.
And.
Let me just caution you on this.
I know what happens a lot of times businesses like yours the
other businesses produce video and then we have video envy.
And then we created just a great ad to say like yeah we're
keeping up with the Joneses.
I don't know.
That's good use of your money.
Now in order for me to do this properly.
I'd probably have to spend quite a bit of time sitting down
talking to you about what the purpose of the video is what
your goals are and how it may or may not work and if it's going
to even be targeted to the right people.
That's going to take a long conversation.
But it would seem disproportionate.
The length of that conversation for your time and my time to
talk about a thousand dollar problem.
What would you like to do?
I don't want to spend more than that.
Then you shouldn't but I'm not the person to do that for you.
And I would encourage you not to spend that money.
With anybody not just me.
Would you like to do?
Probably find somebody that can do the video for a thousand
dollars.
That is your prerogative.
Would you?
Can you recommend anybody?
Yeah I hear this a site called fiver they could do it for five
bucks.
Thanks Chris.
You're welcome.
Best of luck Mel.
So I think that's a very advanced conversation when you
taught me how to talk about money.
Yes.
That was such a big thing but it's just like for a lot of
people starting out.
It's you're so hungry to get that a thousand dollars job when
you're doing videos for 200 bucks and 500 bucks finding
somebody comes and I think that's where like going back to
he says this is where we kind of get the short end of the stick
that we didn't have this type of conversation and then we end up
taking that job for a thousand dollars.
And now we're spending hours doing revisions and really
talking to not get into where we really are.
Ok.
So are you saying to me how do we go that I cannot accept?
No I have to take it.
Well I'm not saying you don't.
I'm just trying to talk.
I mean I'll play it like that too.
I'm just trying to tell people on the Internet it's have an
understanding because I think it's great.
Like you know somebody called me today and they're like I found
somebody that there's videos for 80 bucks.
You hire him.
That video is good.
Let me know.
Because all right I'll give him plenty of work for me to do it.
It's a minimum 1000 miles for video
He's going to be six grand.
I'm like yeah or spend you're eighty dollars and you can get
whatever you want for that but I can't help you with that.
All right.
I just know for other people you know for them to turn away a
thousand dollars.
It's such it's a lot of money for some of them but it's like.
But it's things we learned from the pro group as you got to have
a runway to be able to tell people No.
But also being able to ask these educated questions.
Perfect.
I will respond to that and then Mo
Ok.
I think that you didn't have that thousand dollars before
they called you.
You were gonna make life work regardless.
Don't fall into that mindset like now just because the call I
have to close the job that puts you in a horrible
disadvantageous position don't feel like you have to do that.
I have another way.
If you had set the parameters as Chris you can't say no to the
client you can't refer them to fiver or you must book the job.
I've got another way to do it.
Show them that
Should we jump back in?
Yeah.
Ok.
He didn't give me that parameters.
I mean I did oh let's do it.
So we're not going to do it from the beginning.
Ok.
It's just you want to spend a thousand bucks right.
That's it.
Ok.
What do we have where we add in the conversation kind of out
there like I didn't want to do but you're like that's all I
got?
Ok.
I really really don't want to spend more than a thousand
dollars.
I understand.
A thousand dollars is a lot for you.
I hear your concern.
I'd like to propose something else.
Please.
I'll do the video for you for free.
If we get the results that you want.
I'd like a percentage of the results.
Can we do that?
No risk to you at all.
Sounds fantastic.
What's the percentage that you're thinking.
Well.
We're talking about measuring the difference between traffic
and revenue that you get.
Lots of things I can't control.
So all they want to do is get paid per new customer walks in
your door.
How about since you say each customer is going to spend a
hundred dollars with you?
Let's go half
50 bucks.
No risk to you.
I take all the risk.
And I rely on your honesty.
What's.
The hesitation.
I'm concerned that you're going to make.
A banger video.
All I do is make banger videos.
I know I see them on the portfolio bro facts big facts of
facts.
That's why I called you to begin with.
Yeah.
And then.
We're gonna get a lot of clients in the door.
And then I'm gonna be out 50 percent of that revenue.
What if it exceeds a thousand?
It's going to exceed a thousand.
That's the whole point.
I take all the risk.
You know Peter Drucker is.
I've heard of him
All.
Profit comes from risk.
Mm hmm.
I'm taking on the risk.
Or you just pay me what I'm worth.
And you keep all the profit.
What are you worth?
4000.
That's the minimum.
You need time to think.
Now I was going to break.
I was going to break and actually I said yes you want to
jump in what am I what am I getting for 4000?
I'd like to know what a banger video consists of.
Shall we be time later but are we realistically now
entertaining our 4000 dollar budget.
I'd like to put a non exceed clause on the percentage that
you get.
So we're going back to the.
No no no.
We're not going back.
I appreciate the fact that you're taking on all the risk
but I'm also wanted to be wary that if if you get me a lot of
clients that you're not banking ten thousand dollars for one
video because it might not even cost you that much.
Now I ask you something.
If I can bring in a long line of clients for you.
You're saying please don't do that.
No not at all.
I'm saying Bring me the long line of clients.
I mean but that's what you're saying to me like please help me
do this.
But if it works so well I don't want to pay you anymore.
You just said your minimum level of engagement is 4000
Right.
Let's say that exceeds 4000.
Are you getting paid more than what you need?
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
There must be some confusion here.
I can say that the two options that we have on the table right
now is you pay me four thousand dollars.
We're done.
You keep all the money from that point forward.
That's it.
You just pay me upfront.
Easy peasy.
The other one is I do it for free.
But I take 50 percent of all.
New net revenue.
Because I'm taking on no limits no limits.
Or make you sleep better at night.
How about for the first year?
Does that make you feel better?
You're a wise business man.
I can see that you're doing the calculations in your eyes right
now and you're doing the calculations if this works
you're going to bring in this much money and you're gonna pay
this punk kid this amount of money so you probably think is a
better and more prudent decision just to pay me the 4000
It's your choice.
I'm really like an our back and forth here and you seem really
confident these bangers that you're creating.
And I feel like you're gonna give me more clients and it's
gonna be worth more than 4000.
So I'm going to take the four thousand.
Do that then let's do it?
Ok.
So I'm going to submit a proposal to you.
You sent me two thousand dollars upfront and we'll get goin
That sounds good.
Done one thing always I had it.
But I try and approach one thing they think.
Is for people just starting now?
Yeah it's something that you did.
Is that everything's a negotiation?
Just because he proposed to you that those 1000 dollars like it
isn't mean you have to do everything to there are certain
expectations.
Maybe they want a one minute video.
You could be hey I could do a 30 second video for a thousand
dollars and I just don't get so caught up in the fact that just
because that's what they're giving you.
They're not meeting you at your price you don't have to meet
them at their deliverable.
And you know what you propose.
You know I think it's still something very advanced or
someone that's starting now.
If you are you just kind of getting you know yourself out
there don't be afraid to change the scope of the work.
To meet you know something what you consider is fair.
Yeah.
And that's where I'm going to push this back.
Ok.
That's excellent.
I love that the pro group is so pro that they're doing the meta
commentary on top of the meta commentary
We're just looking out for the.
For the young for you know those ourselves on the spot for that.
You know mean everything is being explained and I love the
grounded conversation.
I love the Metta commentary.
This is like the you're watching a movie and you're getting the
director's commentary while watching the movie as we're
making the movie.
That's how crazy this thing is.





why do you want to know my hourly rate I guess I want to know what where my $188,000 is going does that mean if I work Less hours I should charge you less yeah so if I go over those hours I should charge you more sure really yeah okay so you're saying to me you value this logo taking longer rather than shorter so it means if I just tell you it took me 4 months to work on it you will now owe me $36,000 if it's in my budget and if I think you're worth it but I would also ask why would it take that long to make that logo I would to put a lot of effort into it but could hire somebody else who would charge me the same rate but do it quicker so you value time over money then sure as a business person yeah okay so here's the deal I work really fast I can come up with a logo but I'm being punished from me being efficient and really good you understand the logic doesn't work now sure that's the problem so if I could do a logo for you right now and you love it in 5 minutes are you saying it's worth less than 18 or is it worth more now it's worth more so charging by the hour punishes me for being good





you guys don't realize this but your first point of contact isn't the time in which somebody picks up the phone and says hey oftentimes it's a friend of yours it's a former client it's your website it's search it's social media it's something the way that we're introduced dictates a lot about how the next part of this is going to play out so as i was reading this book how to speak like ted they say that the introduction of the speaker is very very important and you never get to see this except for when you're there live because they edit that part out that's why the speakers never have to introduce themselves so they get somebody really smart who knows this person and then they introduce them and they establish their expertise right from the jump because they have to tell the audience why the next 18 minutes or less are going to be worthwhile so ask yourself how am i introducing myself who's introducing me
