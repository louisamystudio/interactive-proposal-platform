Coaching Brief for Louis Amy AE Studio: Pressure-Testing Value, Tiered Options, Negotiation, and Proposal UX
Prepared for: Chris Do, CEO at The Futur Prepared by: Wesley López, President, Louis Amy AE Studio, LLC Date: September 6, 2025 (Ponce, PR)
Goal: Close a bespoke residential project in Ponce, PR at a premium fee while aligning scope (client is considering bringing their own interior designer).
Where we are now: We have a polished, client-safe proposal page and a sophisticated internal quoting engine. The client has requested the full proposal to review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Pressure-Test Value Narrative and Fee Framing
Louis Amy AE Studio's current proposal effectively uses compelling language and visuals to convey its value, but its fee framing includes elements that contradict a premium, value-based approach, as advocated by Chris Do.
Current Strengths in Value Narrative (from Proposal): The proposal excels at articulating a vision beyond mere construction:
• "Where Vision Meets Bold Innovation".
• Positioning as visionaries, innovators, and problem solvers dedicated to transforming client visions into "precise, visually stunning" and "deeply resonating" spaces.
• Emphasis on being "partners" in crafting homes that embody unique lifestyles and aspirations.
• Leveraging "advanced technologies" (AI, BIM, VR, 3D printing, laser scanning) to deliver spaces that "inspire and transform".
• Highlighting benefits such as Innovation, Efficiency and Speed, Enhanced Collaboration, Risk Reduction, and Exceptional Outcomes.
• A commitment to crafting details that "resonate deeply with your soul".
These statements effectively align with Chris Do's emphasis on selling the transformation and emotional impact rather than just features.
Areas for Improvement in Fee Framing (Aligning with Chris Do's Philosophy):
The most significant misalignment is the detailed breakdown of "Fee Analysis," "Project Phases & Hours Distribution," "Sanity Check," "Total Savings," and the "Hourly Fee Table" in the client-facing proposal. Chris Do strongly advises against hourly rates in client-facing documents, as they measure effort, not value, and punish efficiency.
• Recommendation 1: Eliminate Explicit Hourly Rates and Hour Breakdowns: Remove all mentions of hours, average rates, and hourly fee tables from the client-facing proposal. These are internal project management tools, not value propositions. Chris Do states that if he can create a logo in 5 minutes that a client loves, it's worth more because it saves the client time, allowing them to go to market faster. Explicitly detailing hours invites clients to scrutinize time rather than the delivered outcome.
• Recommendation 2: Reframe "Total Savings": The "Total Savings" subtly shifts the client's focus to cost reduction rather than the intrinsic value of the investment. Instead, frame the "investment" purely around the value created and the transformation achieved. For a bespoke residential project, this means emphasizing the long-term lifestyle enhancement, peace of mind, quality, and unique experience, rather than a discount from an "Industry Standard". A premium service commands a premium, not a discount.
• Recommendation 3: Focus on Outcomes and Desired Future State: Throughout all fee discussions, constantly tie the price back to the desired future state and the impact for the client. For a high-end residence, this could be the legacy, the sanctuary, the status, or the seamless functionality that Louis Amy's integrated design provides.
2. Engineer Tiered Options Protecting Margin
The client's consideration of bringing their own interior designer presents both a challenge and an opportunity to offer value-based tiered options. The goal is to protect your margin while making Louis Amy's integrated solution the most compelling.
Chris Do's Principle: When pricing, "price the customer, not the product". The value of a service is different based on the client's potential gains and risks. Present a large price range initially to anchor high and engage in dialogue about what determines higher value.
Proposed Tiered Options:
1. Option A: The Fully Integrated Vision (Premium)
    ◦ Description: This option represents Louis Amy AE Studio as the sole, holistic design partner, managing all aspects of architecture, interior design, and landscape design from concept to construction oversight.
    ◦ Value Proposition: Emphasize seamless integration, maximum coherence, unwavering commitment to excellence, and ensuring the home "resonate deeply with the soul". Highlight the risk reduction and efficiency of a single point of responsibility. This is the "insanely great" standard.
    ◦ Fee Structure: A single, value-based fixed fee for the entire project, reflecting the comprehensive expertise, coordination, and the ultimate transformative outcome. Avoid any internal cost breakdowns or hourly rates.
    ◦ Strategic Advantage: This option anchors the highest value and demonstrates Louis Amy's ideal partnership model. It positions your studio as the ultimate solution for a client seeking a truly bespoke, unified vision.
2. Option B: Collaborative Partnership (Mid-Tier)
    ◦ Description: Louis Amy AE Studio provides core architectural design and project oversight, and actively collaborates and coordinates with the client's chosen interior designer. This would align with "Supplemental Services" that involve subconsultants, where Louis Amy charges a "15% Coordination Fee".
    ◦ Value Proposition: Focus on enhanced collaboration and Louis Amy's expertise in ensuring architectural and interior harmony. Highlight the studio's role in risk mitigation by integrating external input professionally and maintaining the overall design integrity. Present Louis Amy as the "conductor" of the design orchestra, even with an external interior designer.
    ◦ Fee Structure: A fixed fee for architectural services, plus a clearly stated, value-based fee for "Design Integration & Coordination Services" with the client's interior designer. This fee should be presented as a fixed amount, not an hourly rate or a percentage directly tied to the interior designer's costs (though it can be derived internally from that). This fee reflects the value of reduced client burden, smoother communication, and integrated project delivery.
    ◦ Strategic Advantage: This option acknowledges the client's desire for an external interior designer while still demonstrating Louis Amy's critical role in ensuring a cohesive, high-quality outcome. It preserves more of Louis Amy's value proposition than a purely architectural scope.
3. Option C: Architectural Foundation (Base-Tier)
    ◦ Description: Louis Amy AE Studio provides architectural design services only, with the client entirely responsible for the selection, management, and integration of their own interior designer.
    ◦ Value Proposition: Focus on providing a "precise and functional architectural framework." Clearly delineate the boundaries of Louis Amy's involvement.
    ◦ Fee Structure: A fixed fee solely for architectural design services.
    ◦ Strategic Advantage/Consideration: This option should be presented in a way that subtly highlights the potential challenges or increased workload for the client if they choose this path. For example, "While this option provides the essential architectural framework, the responsibility for achieving a cohesive interior aesthetic and coordinating with your chosen interior designer will rest solely with you, requiring significant client involvement to ensure seamless integration with our architectural vision." This approach implicitly encourages the client to consider the value of Options A or B by emphasizing the lack of holistic integration and increased client effort. Do not discount this option so heavily that it devalues your core architectural service. The margin should be protected, potentially by a higher relative fee for the remaining scope, reflecting the complexity of designing in isolation or the potential for greater back-and-forth if interior choices clash.
3. Build a Concession/Trade-Off Strategy and Negotiation Script
A successful negotiation involves asking great questions, listening intently, and focusing on value and transformation rather than just price. Chris Do emphasizes that sales is change management—helping clients move from a current state to a desired future state.
Pre-Negotiation (Before Sending Proposal): The initial calls are critical. Louis Amy should ask "big, beautiful, wonderful questions" to uncover the client's deepest desires, fears, and definition of success for their home.
• "Dr. De Jesus, beyond the physical structure, what does this new home truly represent for you and your family? What kind of feeling do you want to evoke every time you step through the door?" (Emotional value).
• "What concerns do you have about the design and construction process, or about achieving this vision seamlessly?" (Pain points/risks).
• "If this project were to be a complete success, what would that look like and feel like for you a year from now, five years from now?" (Desired future state/impact).
• "You mentioned considering an external interior designer. Could you elaborate on what's important to you in that decision, and how you envision their role integrating with the architectural vision?" (Uncover the "why" behind their intent).
Negotiation Script (Upon Client Review of Proposal):
• Anchoring High: If not already done in earlier conversations, the initial presentation of Option A (Fully Integrated Vision) serves as a high anchor. This makes subsequent options seem more reasonable.
• Responding to "Your Price is Too High":
    ◦ Reframe as Value Conversation: "Dr. De Jesus, I understand that the investment for the [Option A/B] proposal is substantial. To ensure we're aligning perfectly with your vision, could you share what aspects of the investment feel misaligned with the value you anticipate, or what specifically is giving you pause?" (Shift from cost to value perception).
    ◦ Tie to Transformation: "If we could guarantee that this integrated design would deliver a home that truly elevates your lifestyle, provides unparalleled peace of mind throughout the process, and becomes a cherished legacy for generations, what would that ultimate transformation be worth to you?" (Focus on the deepest emotional and long-term benefits).
    ◦ Risk Reversal (Advanced Tactic): If the client pushes hard on price for a specific option, Chris Do suggests offering to do the work for free in exchange for a percentage of the results. For a residential project, this might look like: "Dr. De Jesus, we are so confident in our ability to deliver exceptional architectural and design value that for the core design scope, we could offer to work for a reduced upfront fee, in exchange for a percentage of the increased market value of your property two years after completion, specifically attributable to our design. This removes almost all financial risk from you on the design outcome and ties our success directly to yours. Would you be open to exploring a partnership based on that model?" (This challenges them to acknowledge the financial value of the design, and shows immense confidence in Louis Amy's work).
• Concession/Trade-off Strategy (Leveraging Tiered Options):
    ◦ Start with Option A. Emphasize its comprehensive benefits as the "ideal" path for a truly seamless and value-maximized outcome.
    ◦ If client prefers separate ID: Gently pivot to Option B. "We absolutely respect your desire to work with a specific interior designer. That's why we've prepared our Collaborative Partnership option. While it reduces the overall fee compared to our fully integrated approach, it still ensures our team actively coordinates with your chosen designer. This preserves the synergy between architecture and interiors, reducing potential friction and ensuring a more cohesive final vision, allowing you to focus on your life rather than managing multiple design teams."
    ◦ If client pushes for Option C: Clearly define what's not included and the potential challenges for them. "With the Architectural Foundation option, our focus is solely on the structural and foundational design. While this gives you complete freedom with your interior designer, it places the full responsibility on you to manage the integration and coordination of their work with our architectural plans. This means a less seamless process and potentially more direct oversight from your end to ensure all elements align aesthetically and functionally." This is about making it harder to work with you on a lower value tier, to ensure you maintain a premium perception and protect your effort.
    ◦ Avoid "Price Match" Concessions: Do not simply lower your price to match a competitor's. If you must lower the price, tie it to a reduction in scope or deliverables for the client, or a clear understanding of the reduced value/increased risk for them. For example, instead of reducing the fee for Option B, explain that the additional time they will have to spend coordinating would be the "cost" of that decision.
4. Sharpen the Proposal UX to Reduce Friction and Boost Perceived Value
The current proposal is visually strong, but the inclusion of internal financial details creates friction and can undermine perceived value.
Recommendations for Proposal UX Redesign:
1. Remove All Internal Financial Mechanics:
    ◦ Delete these slides entirely from client-facing proposals: "Fee Analysis," "Project Phases & Hours Distribution," "Sanity Check," and the "Hourly Fee Table". These expose your internal process and encourage clients to negotiate based on effort (hours) rather than outcome (value). Chris Do explicitly argues against charging by the hour because it measures effort, not results, and punishes efficiency.
    ◦ For "Supplemental Services," instead of "Cost + 15% Fee" and an explicit "Hourly Fee Table", consider presenting fixed fees for well-defined supplemental scopes. If external consultants are involved, present a single consolidated fixed fee for each supplemental service (consultant cost + your coordination fee), emphasizing the convenience and quality assurance. This maintains a value-based approach.
2. Refine "Your Investment" Section (Slides 46-52):
    ◦ Reframe "Total Savings": Instead of "$45,915 Total Savings", replace this with language that reinforces the value of the investment. Examples:
        ▪ "Your Investment for a Legacy Home."
        ▪ "Delivering Unparalleled Value: [Final Contract Price]"
        ▪ "Securing Your Vision: [Final Contract Price]"
        ▪ If a previous higher budget or scope was discussed, consider phrasing like, "Your Investment reflects the optimized scope for your vision, delivering [specific benefits] for [Final Contract Price]." This pivots from a discount to a tailored solution.
    ◦ Simplify "Construction Budget Allocation" and "Budget Distribution": While these show transparency, they also invite micro-analysis. Consider visually emphasizing the proportional investment into various components (e.g., Architecture, Interior, Landscape) rather than exact dollar figures, focusing on what each component contributes to the holistic vision. For example, "Thoughtful Allocation to Realize Your Vision" followed by a simplified visual breakdown (perhaps by percentage) of investment categories.
    ◦ Focus on the "Why": Ensure every numerical presentation is accompanied by the "why" – the value, benefit, or transformation it provides. For instance, rather than just "Architecture: $377,175", a sub-note could read "Investing in the foundational artistry and structural integrity of your unique home."
3. Enhance the "Journey" and "Philosophy" sections:
    ◦ The "Collaborative Journey" and "Our Philosophy" are strong. Ensure that the language consistently highlights the client's experience and the value they receive at each stage (e.g., "Discovery" leads to "clarity for your vision," "Creative" leads to "masterpieces that balance aesthetics and functionality").
    ◦ Use strong, evocative words. For example, instead of just "Site Analysis & Layout", it could be framed as "Strategic Site Mastery for Optimal Design."
4. Leverage Visual Storytelling for Emotion:
    ◦ The proposal already features stunning visuals. Continue to use these to evoke the emotional desired future state for the client. The QR codes to explore in 3D are excellent for immersion. This directly taps into Chris Do's idea of creating an emotional connection.
By implementing these changes, Louis Amy AE Studio can present a proposal that not only looks exceptional but also strategically communicates value in a way that resonates with Chris Do's philosophy, protects margins, and guides the client towards a premium, transformative partnership.
