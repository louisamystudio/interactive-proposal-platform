Absolutely—let’s tighten these three slides so they’re crisp, value‑based, and contradiction‑free, and give you a fresh, format‑ready deck you can drop into the proposal now.

What I fixed (at a glance)

Removed internal math/explanations and any “minus X + Y = total” language (keeps the focus on value, not components).

Corrected scope conflicts you had on B and C (duplicate “Core visualization” on B; C listed Landscape in inclusions but also in exclusions).

Standardized visualization language per tier (A = interior & exterior VR; B = exterior VR + optional add‑on for interior; C = no VR).

Kept one fixed price per option and disciplines distribution phrased as “illustrative” (value framing, not cost‑plus).

Preserved the premium anchor for Option A. If you want to push anchoring harder, we can float $183,658 (Louis Amy price) or the $187,099 market card as the leading anchor.

Polished, paste‑ready copy (use this verbatim on each slide)
Slide 01 — Option A · Fully Integrated Vision (Premium Anchor)

Fixed Investment: $187,099
What’s included

Single, integrated team: Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape + full Structural/Civil/Plumbing coordination—one accountable studio.

Reality Capture (Scan‑to‑BIM): building + site; BIM federation & clash‑resolved documentation to reduce surprises.

Visualization: Interior + Exterior VR previews for confident decisions and fewer late changes.

Ideal when you want maximum cohesion, faster decisions, and single‑point accountability.

Design Services Distribution (illustrative):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~4% ≈ $7,484 · Building Shell ~60% ≈ $112,259 · Interior ~24% ≈ $44,904 · Landscape ~12% ≈ $22,452.

Slide 02 — Option B · Collaborative Partnership

(Architecture‑led + your interior designer)
Fixed Investment: $126,636
What’s included

Authored by Louis Amy: Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing permit deliverables; Landscape Architecture by Louis Amy.

Design Integration & Coordination with your interior designer: interfaces matrix, BIM federation, clash detection & resolution, review gates, change‑management.

Reality Capture baseline (Scan‑to‑BIM).

Visualization: Exterior VR for reviews; interior hero renders/VR available as a priced add‑on.

Ideal when you want to keep a trusted interior designer while preserving architectural coherence and schedule certainty.

Design Services Distribution (illustrative):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~5% ≈ $6,332 · Building Shell ~65% ≈ $82,314 · Landscape ~12% ≈ $15,196 · Design Integration & Coordination ~18% ≈ $22,794.
(Prices a strategic integration role—charging for thinking/oversight, not hours.)

Slide 03 — Option C · Architectural Foundation (Shell + Outdoor Baseline)

Fixed Investment: $87,898
What’s included

Authored by Louis Amy: Architecture + Structural/Civil/Plumbing permit deliverables.

Reality Capture baseline (Scan‑to‑BIM).

Exclusions: Interior & Landscape authored by others; our documents note interfaces only. Dedicated interior‑design integration is not included.

Visualization: 3D interior renderings and VR are out of scope in this tier.

Best for a compliant architectural base with client‑side coordination responsibility.

Design Services Distribution (illustrative):
Scan‑to‑BIM ~6% ≈ $5,274 · Building Shell ~94% ≈ $82,624 (no Interiors or Landscape authoring in this tier).

Micro‑notes to keep the deck “Chris‑Do clean”

Keep one number per option (fixed investment). No internal arithmetic; no hourly tables.

Use “Distribution (illustrative)” to communicate scope emphasis while avoiding cost‑plus vibes.

For supplemental items (e.g., premium visualization packs, specialized engineering), present fixed‑fee add‑ons that bundle any coordination—avoid “cost + 15%”.

Maintain your standard commercial terms on a separate slide (20% non‑refundable kickoff; 30‑day validity; decision‑window clause).

If you want, I can append these 3 slides to your working file (Proposal Luis De Jesus.pptx) or replace your current “Your Investment” pages with these.
