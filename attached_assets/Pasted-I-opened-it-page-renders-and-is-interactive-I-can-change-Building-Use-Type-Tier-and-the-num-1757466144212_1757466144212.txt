I opened it—page renders and is interactive. I can change **Building Use / Type / Tier** and the numbers update; however the admin footer still shows the red banner **“Error: Failed to load database defaults”** (so some reads are falling back / timing-out).

Here’s a tight checklist to get this view fully green and data-true:

### What to verify right now (fast)

* **Category multiplier** displayed/used = DB value (1→0.9, 2→1.0, 3→1.1, 4→1.2, 5→1.3). If UI math differs, your API should read it from `category_multipliers` and not hard-code.&#x20;
* **PSF min/target/max** for the chosen Use/Type/Tier = the row in the **PR 2025 construction-cost index** (sum of shell + interior + landscape bands for New vs Remodel). If target differs, you’re likely on a fallback path—wire the GET to the DB row for that classification.&#x20;
* **Default shares** (Shell / Interior / Landscape) = DB defaults or SSOT (typically 66/22/12). Make sure the card shows **\$ + %** and normalizes to 100%.&#x20;

### If the “DB defaults” error persists

1. **Cost-config route** should read from `building_cost_data` + `category_multipliers`. Add a simple health check and log the tuple (use, type, tier) you’re querying.
2. Confirm env + network: the server route must run **server-side only**; no client attempts to import the DB module.
3. Keep **fallbacks** for resilience, but show a yellow “Using safe defaults” banner only when a DB miss occurs (not red).

### Section hygiene (narrative correctness)

* **Construction budget (minimum to build)** = “PR cost DB” math, not design fees. Keep the one-liner in Project Overview that says fees are separate.&#x20;
* **Design fees (admin-only view)** = Top-Down (market % × category multiplier) vs Bottom-Up (non-linear hours × labor & overhead), with admin discount ≤25% and **Contract = max** of the two. Constants live in the SSOT: `HFA_OFFSET=0.08`, `HOURS_BASE_A=0.21767`, `HOURS_BASE_B=11.21274`, exponent −0.53816, `MARKET_FEE_RATE=0.178025631`, `MAX_DISCOUNT=0.25`.&#x20;
* **Engineering disciplines** = Shell × engineering shares; **Architecture = remainder** (make that explicit in the card).&#x20;

### Quick acceptance checks (use the Residential → Custom Houses, Tier 3 fixture)

* Total budget = **\$859,365** (4,407 ft² × \$195/ft²).
* Shares = **Shell 66%**, Interior 22%, Landscape 12% (unless a DB row specifies different defaults).
* Fee panel: shows **Top-Down**, **Bottom-Up**, and **Contract**; slider capped at **25%**; “winner” chip correct.
* Client path (proposal link) never exposes hours/rates/discount—only Option A/B/C with A first and value copy.&#x20;

If you want, I can run a focused pass on **Budget shares** and **Discipline cards** next (to ensure normalized \$+% and “Architecture = remainder” with New/Remodel expanders) and draft the tiny healthcheck so the red banner goes away.


The admin calculator page opened successfully this time, showing a fully connected state with data loaded from the Puerto Rico construction-cost database. The interface displays all sections—from Project Overview down through Budget Allocation, Engineering Disciplines, Top‑Down vs Bottom‑Up analyses, Contract pricing, Investment Options, Sanity Check, and Hours by Phase/Role/Discipline. Notably, the previous red “Failed to load database defaults” banner is gone—the header now shows “Database: Connected (Read‑Only)” and the Database Architecture card confirms the main cost DB and live overrides status.

As you scroll, each module displays consistent numbers tied to the current classification (Residential → Custom Houses → Tier 3), including normalized budget shares (Shell 62%, Interior 24%, Landscape 14% with dollar values), architecture as the remainder of Shell across disciplines, the fee comparison section with admin discount, and a Contract price derived from discounted market vs Louis Amy fee. The Client Options section still offers the A/B/C tiers with premium language and no internal numbers.

If you need any specific interactions or data checks while exploring this view—such as toggling building use/type/tier or regenerating a proposal—just let me know and I can walk through them.
