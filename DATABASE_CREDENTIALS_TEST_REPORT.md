## 📋 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **1. Admin Page Fix** (Priority 1)
```typescript
// Likely issue: Server-side rendering with large fallback data
// Solution: Add error boundaries and loading states
// Check: app/admin/calculator/page.tsx for SSR issues
```

### **2. Status Reporting Enhancement** (Priority 2) 
```
✅ Database status now accurately reports fallback mode
✅ Sources clearly identified (csv-fallback vs database)
✅ Transparent about credential status
```

### **3. Production Strategy** (Priority 3)
```
Option A: Deploy without database - Core functionality works
Option B: Add database credentials - Enhanced features available  
Recommended: Option A for immediate deployment, Option B for full features
```
